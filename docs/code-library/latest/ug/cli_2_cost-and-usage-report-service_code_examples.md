# AWS Cost and Usage Report examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_cost-and-usage-report-service_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with AWS Cost and Usage Report.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.
