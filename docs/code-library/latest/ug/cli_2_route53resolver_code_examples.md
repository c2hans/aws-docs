# Route 53 Resolver examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_route53resolver_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with Route 53 Resolver.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

### `associate-firewall-rule-group`
<a name="route53resolver_AssociateFirewallRuleGroup_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `associate-firewall-rule-group`.

**AWS CLI**
**To associate a firewall rule group with a VPC**
The following `associate-firewall-rule-group` example associates a DNS Firewall rule group with an Amazon VPC.

```
aws route53resolver associate-firewall-rule-group \
    --name {{test-association}} \
    --firewall-rule-group-id {{rslvr-frg-47f93271fexample}} \
    --vpc-id {{vpc-31e92222}} \
    --priority {{101}}
```
Output:

```

### `associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address`
<a name="route53resolver_AssociateResolverEndpointIpAddress_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address`.

**AWS CLI**
**To associate another IP address with a Resolver endpoint**
The following `associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address` example associates another IP address with an inbound Resolver endpoint. If you specify only a subnet ID and omit the IP address from the `--ip-address` parameter, Resolver chooses an IP address for you from among the available IP addresses in the specified subnet.

```
aws route53resolver associate-resolver-endpoint-ip-address \
    --resolver-endpoint-id {{rslvr-in-497098ad5example}} \
    --ip-address="SubnetId=subnet-12d8exam,Ip=192.0.2.118"
```

After you run `put-resolver-rule-policy`, you can run the following two Resource Access Manager (RAM) commands. You must use the account that you want to share the rule with:
`get-resource-share-invitations` returns the value `resourceShareInvitationArn`. You need this value to accept the invitation to use the shared rule.`accept-resource-share-invitation` accepts the invitation to use the shared rule.

```
aws route53resolver update-resolver-rule \
    --resolver-rule-id {{rslvr-rr-1247fa64f3example}} \
    --config Name="my-2nd-rule",TargetIps=[{Ip=192.0.2.45,Port=53},{Ip=192.0.2.46,Port=53}],ResolverEndpointId=rslvr-out-7b89ed0d25example
