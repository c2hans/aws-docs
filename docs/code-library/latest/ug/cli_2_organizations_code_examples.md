# Organizations examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_organizations_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with Organizations.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

### `create-account`
<a name="organizations_CreateAccount_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-account`.

**AWS CLI**
**To create a member account that is automatically part of the organization**
The following example shows how to create a member account in an organization. The member account is configured with the name Production Account and the email address of susan@example.com. Organizations automatically creates an IAM role using the default name of OrganizationAccountAccessRole because the roleName parameter is not specified. Also, the setting that allows IAM users or roles with sufficient permissions to access account billing data is set to the default value of ALLOW because the IamUserAccessToBilling parameter is not specified. Organizations automatically sends Susan a "Welcome to AWS" email:

```
aws organizations create-account --email {{susan@example.com}} --account-name {{"Production Account"}}
```
The output includes a request object that shows that the status is now `IN_PROGRESS`:

```
{
        "CreateAccountStatus": {
                "State": "IN_PROGRESS",
                "Id": "car-examplecreateaccountrequestid111"
        }
}
```
You can later query the current status of the request by providing the Id response value to the describe-create-account-status command as the value for the create-account-request-id parameter.
For more information, see Creating an AWS Account in Your Organization in the *AWS Organizations Users Guide*.

### `create-organization`
<a name="organizations_CreateOrganization_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-organization`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: To create a new organization**
Bill wants to create an organization using credentials from account 111111111111. The following example shows that the account becomes the master account in the new organization. Because he does not specify a features set, the new organization defaults to all features enabled and service control policies are enabled on the root.

```
aws organizations create-organization
```
The output includes an organization object with details about the new organization:

```
{
        "Organization": {
                "AvailablePolicyTypes": [
                        {
                                "Status": "ENABLED",

        }
}
```
**Example 2: To create a new organization with only consolidated billing features enabled**
The following example creates an organization that supports only the consolidated billing features:

```
aws organizations create-organization --feature-set {{CONSOLIDATED_BILLING}}
```
The output includes an organization object with details about the new organization:

```
{
        "Organization": {
                "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:organization/o-exampleorgid",
                "AvailablePolicyTypes": [],
                "Id": "o-exampleorgid",
                "MasterAccountArn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:account/o-exampleorgid/111111111111",
                "MasterAccountEmail": "bill@example.com",
                "MasterAccountId": "111111111111",
                "FeatureSet": "CONSOLIDATED_BILLING"
        }
}

### `create-organizational-unit`
<a name="organizations_CreateOrganizationalUnit_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-organizational-unit`.

**AWS CLI**
**To create an OU in a root or parent OU**
The following example shows how to create an OU that is named AccountingOU:

```
aws organizations create-organizational-unit --parent-id {{r-examplerootid111}} --name {{AccountingOU}}
```
The output includes an organizationalUnit object with details about the new OU:

```
{
        "OrganizationalUnit": {
                "Id": "ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111",
                "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:ou/o-exampleorgid/ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111",
                "Name": "AccountingOU",
                "Path": "o-exampleorgid/r-examplerootid111/ou-examplerootid111-exampleouid111/"
        }
}

### `create-policy`
<a name="organizations_CreatePolicy_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-policy`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: To create a policy with a text source file for the JSON policy**
The following example shows you how to create an service control policy (SCP) named `AllowAllS3Actions`. The policy contents are taken from a file on the local computer called `policy.json`.

```
aws organizations create-policy --content {{file://policy.json}} --name {{AllowAllS3Actions,}} --type {{SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY}} --description {{"Allows delegation of all S3 actions"}}
```
The output includes a policy object with details about the new policy:

```
{
        "Policy": {
                "Content": "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}",
                "PolicySummary": {
                        "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::o-exampleorgid:policy/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid111",
                        "Description": "Allows delegation of all S3 actions",
                        "Name": "AllowAllS3Actions",
                        "Type":"SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
                }
        }
}
```
**Example 2: To create a policy with a JSON policy as a parameter**
The following example shows you how to create the same SCP, this time by embedding the policy contents as a JSON string in the parameter. The string must be escaped with backslashes before the double quotes to ensure that they are treated as literals in the parameter, which itself is surrounded by double quotes:

```
aws organizations create-policy --content "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":[{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":[\"s3:*\"],\"Resource\":[\"*\"]}]}" --name {{AllowAllS3Actions}} --type {{SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY}} --description {{"Allows delegation of all S3 actions"}}

The following example shows you how to replace the JSON text of the SCP in the previous example with a new JSON policy text string that allows S3 instead of EC2:

```
aws organizations update-policy \
    --policy-id {{p-examplepolicyid111}} \
    --content "{\"Version\":\"2012-10-17\",\"Statement\":{\"Effect\":\"Allow\",\"Action\":\"s3:*\",\"Resource\":\"*\"}}"
```
The output shows the new content:

```
{
    "Policy": {
        "Content": "{ \"Version\": \"2012-10-17\", \"Statement\": { \"Effect\": \"Allow\", \"Action\": \"s3:*\", \"Resource\": \"*\" } }",
        "PolicySummary": {
            "Arn": "arn:aws:organizations::111111111111:policy/o-exampleorgid/service_control_policy/p-examplepolicyid111",
            "AwsManaged": false;
            "Description": "This description replaces the original.",
            "Id": "p-examplepolicyid111",
            "Name": "Renamed-Policy",
            "Type": "SERVICE_CONTROL_POLICY"
        }
    }
}
```
