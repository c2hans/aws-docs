# CloudWatch Network Monitoring examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_networkmonitor_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with CloudWatch Network Monitoring.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

### `create-monitor`
<a name="networkmonitor_CreateMonitor_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-monitor`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: To create a network monitor with an aggregation period**
The following `create-monitor` example creates a monitor named `Example_NetworkMonitor` with an `aggregationPeriod` set to `30` seconds. The initial `state` of the monitor will be `INACTIVE` because there are no probes associated with it. The state changes to `ACTIVE` only when probes are added. You can use the [update-monitor](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/networkmonitor/update-monitor.html) or [create-probe](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/networkmonitor/create-probe.html) commands to add probes to this monitor.

```
aws networkmonitor create-monitor \
     --monitor-name {{Example_NetworkMonitor}} \
     --aggregation-period {{30}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "monitorArn": "arn:aws:networkmonitor:region:111122223333:monitor/Example_NetworkMonitor",
    "monitorName": "Example_NetworkMonitor",
    "state": "INACTIVE",
    "aggregationPeriod": 30,
    "tags": {}
}
```
For more information, see [How Amazon CloudWatch Network Monitor Works](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/nw-monitor-how-it-works.html) in the *Amazon CloudWatch User Guide*.
**Example 2: To create a network monitor with a probe using TCP and also includes tags**
The following `create-monitor` example creates a monitor named `Example_NetworkMonitor`. The command also creates one probe that uses the `ICMP` protocol and includes tags. Since no `aggregationPeriod` is passed in the request, `60` seconds is set as the default. The `state` of the monitor with the probe will be `PENDING` until the monitor is `ACTIVE`. This might take several minutes, at which point the `state` will change to `ACTIVE`, and you can start viewing CloudWatch metrics.

```
aws networkmonitor create-monitor \
    --monitor-name {{Example_NetworkMonitor}} \
    --probes {{sourceArn=arn:aws:ec2:region:111122223333:subnet/subnet-id,destination=10.0.0.100,destinationPort=80,protocol=TCP,packetSize=56,probeTags={Name=Probe1}}} \
    --tags {{Monitor=Monitor1}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "monitorArn": "arn:aws:networkmonitor:region111122223333:monitor/Example_NetworkMonitor",
    "monitorName": "Example_NetworkMonitor",
    "state": "PENDING",
    "aggregationPeriod": 60,
    "tags": {
        "Monitor": "Monitor1"
    }
}
```

**Example 3: To create a network monitor with a probe using ICMP and also includes tags**
The following `create-monitor` example creates a monitor named `Example_NetworkMonitor` with an `aggregationPeriod` of `30` seconds. The command also creates one probe that uses the `ICMP` protocol and includes tags. Since no `aggregationPeriod` is passed in the request, `60` seconds is set as the default. The `state` of the monitor with the probe will be `PENDING` until the monitor is `ACTIVE`. This might take several minutes, at which point the `state` will change to `ACTIVE`, and you can start viewing CloudWatch metrics.

```
aws networkmonitor create-monitor \
     --monitor-name {{Example_NetworkMonitor}} \
     --aggregation-period {{30}} \
     --probes {{sourceArn=arn:aws:ec2:region111122223333:subnet/subnet-id,destination=10.0.0.100,protocol=ICMP,packetSize=56,probeTags={Name=Probe1}}} \
     --tags {{Monitor=Monitor1}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "monitorArn": "arn:aws:networkmonitor:region:111122223333:monitor/Example_NetworkMonitor",
    "monitorName": "Example_NetworkMonitor",
    "state": "PENDING",

### `create-probe`
<a name="networkmonitor_CreateProbe_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-probe`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: To create a probe that uses TCP and add it to a network monitor**
The following `create-probe` example creates a probe that uses the `TCP` `protocol` and adds the probe to a monitor named `Example_NetworkMonitor`. Once created, the `state` of the monitor with the probe will be `PENDING` until the monitor is `ACTIVE`. This might take several minutes, at which point the state will change to `ACTIVE`, and you can start viewing CloudWatch metrics.

```
aws networkmonitor create-probe \
    --monitor-name {{Example_NetworkMonitor}} \
    --probe {{sourceArn=arn:aws:ec2:region:111122223333:subnet/subnet-id,destination=10.0.0.100,destinationPort=80,protocol=TCP,packetSize=56,tags={Name=Probe1}}}
