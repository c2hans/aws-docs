Consuming an Amazon MSK event with Lambda using Ruby.

```
require 'base64'

def lambda_handler(event:, context:)
  # Iterate through keys
  event['records'].each do |key, records|
    puts "Key: #{key}"

    # Iterate through records
    records.each do |record|
      puts "Record: #{record}"

      # Decode base64
      msg = Base64.decode64(record['value'])
      puts "Message: #{msg}"
    end
  end
end
