<a name="javascript_3_cognito-identity_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS SDK for JavaScript (v3) with Amazon Cognito Identity.

*Scenarios* are code examples that show you how to accomplish specific tasks by calling multiple functions within a service or combined with other AWS services.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

The following code example shows how to explore Amazon Textract output through an interactive application.

**SDK for JavaScript (v3)**
 Shows how to use the AWS SDK for JavaScript to build a React application that uses Amazon Textract to extract data from a document image and display it in an interactive web page. This example runs in a web browser and requires an authenticated Amazon Cognito identity for credentials. It uses Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) for storage, and for notifications it polls an Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue that is subscribed to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic.
 For complete source code and instructions on how to set up and run, see the full example on [GitHub](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/javascriptv3/example_code/cross-services/textract-react).
