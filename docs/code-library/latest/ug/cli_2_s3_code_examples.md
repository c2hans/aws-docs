# Amazon S3 examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_s3_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with Amazon S3.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

### `abort-multipart-upload`
<a name="s3_AbortMultipartUpload_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `abort-multipart-upload`.

**AWS CLI**
**To abort the specified multipart upload**
The following `abort-multipart-upload` command aborts a multipart upload for the key `multipart/01` in the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`.

```
aws s3api abort-multipart-upload \
    --bucket {{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} \
    --key {{multipart/01}} \
    --upload-id {{dfRtDYU0WWCCcH43C3WFbkRONycyCpTJJvxu2i5GYkZljF.Yxwh6XG7WfS2vC4to6HiV6Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ8P3URCSbB7rjxI5iEwVDmgaXZOGgkk5nVTW16HOQ5l0R}}
```
The upload ID required by this command is output by `create-multipart-upload` and can also be retrieved with `list-multipart-uploads`.
+  For API details, see [AbortMultipartUpload](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/s3api/abort-multipart-upload.html) in *AWS CLI Command Reference*.

### `complete-multipart-upload`
<a name="s3_CompleteMultipartUpload_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `complete-multipart-upload`.

**AWS CLI**
The following command completes a multipart upload for the key `multipart/01` in the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```
aws s3api complete-multipart-upload --multipart-upload {{file://mpustruct}} --bucket {{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} --key '{{multipart/01}}' --upload-id {{dfRtDYU0WWCCcH43C3WFbkRONycyCpTJJvxu2i5GYkZljF.Yxwh6XG7WfS2vC4to6HiV6Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ8P3URCSbB7rjxI5iEwVDmgaXZOGgkk5nVTW16HOQ5l0R}}
```
The upload ID required by this command is output by `create-multipart-upload` and can also be retrieved with `list-multipart-uploads`.
The multipart upload option in the above command takes a JSON structure that describes the parts of the multipart upload that should be reassembled into the complete file. In this example, the `file://` prefix is used to load the JSON structure from a file in the local folder named `mpustruct`.
mpustruct:

```
{
  "Parts": [
    {
      "ETag": "e868e0f4719e394144ef36531ee6824c",
      "PartNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "ETag": "6bb2b12753d66fe86da4998aa33fffb0",
      "PartNumber": 2
    },
    {
      "ETag": "d0a0112e841abec9c9ec83406f0159c8",
      "PartNumber": 3
    }
  ]
}
```
The ETag value for each part is upload is output each time you upload a part using the `upload-part` command and can also be retrieved by calling `list-parts` or calculated by taking the MD5 checksum of each part.
Output:

```
{
    "ETag": "\"3944a9f7a4faab7f78788ff6210f63f0-3\"",
    "Bucket": "amzn-s3-demo-bucket",
    "Location": "https://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/multipart%2F01",
    "Key": "multipart/01"
}
```

```
**Example 3: Copying a file from S3 to S3**
The following `cp` command copies a single S3 object to a specified bucket and key:

```
aws s3 cp {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt}}
```
Output:

```
copy: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt
```
**Example 4: Copying an S3 object to a local file**
The following `cp` command copies a single object to a specified file locally:

```
aws s3 cp {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt}} {{test2.txt}}
```

```
Output:

```
copy: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/test.txt
```
**Example 6: Recursively copying S3 objects to a local directory**
When passed with the parameter `--recursive`, the following `cp` command recursively copies all objects under a specified prefix and bucket to a specified directory. In this example, the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` has the objects `test1.txt` and `test2.txt`:

```
aws s3 cp {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} {{.}} \
    --recursive
```
Output:

```
download: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test1.txt to test1.txt
download: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt to test2.txt
```
**Example 7: Recursively copying local files to S3**
When passed with the parameter `--recursive`, the following `cp` command recursively copies all files under a specified directory to a specified bucket and prefix while excluding some files by using an `--exclude` parameter. In this example, the directory `myDir` has the files `test1.txt` and `test2.jpg`:

```
aws s3 cp {{myDir}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/}} \
    --recursive \
    --exclude {{"*.jpg"}}
```
Output:

```
upload: myDir/test1.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test1.txt
```
**Example 8: Recursively copying S3 objects to another bucket**
When passed with the parameter `--recursive`, the following `cp` command recursively copies all objects under a specified bucket to another bucket while excluding some objects by using an `--exclude` parameter. In this example, the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` has the objects `test1.txt` and `another/test1.txt`:

```
aws s3 cp {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/}} \
    --recursive \
    --exclude {{"another/*"}}
```
Output:

```
copy: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test1.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/test1.txt
```
You can combine `--exclude` and `--include` options to copy only objects that match a pattern, excluding all others:

```
aws s3 cp {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/logs/}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/logs/}} \
    --recursive \
    --exclude {{"*"}} \
    --include {{"*.log"}}
```
Output:

```
copy: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/logs/test/test.log to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/logs/test/test.log
copy: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/logs/test3.log to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/logs/test3.log
```
**Example 9: Setting the Access Control List (ACL) while copying an S3 object**
The following `cp` command copies a single object to a specified bucket and key while setting the ACL to `public-read-write`:

```
aws s3 cp {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt}} \
    --acl {{public-read-write}}
```
Output:

```
copy: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt
```
Note that if you're using the `--acl` option, ensure that any associated IAM policies include the `"s3:PutObjectAcl"` action:

```
aws iam get-user-policy \
    --user-name {{myuser}} \
    --policy-name {{mypolicy}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "UserName": "myuser",
    "PolicyName": "mypolicy",
    "PolicyDocument": {
        "Version":"2012-10-17",
        "Statement": [
            {
                "Action": [
                    "s3:PutObject",
                    "s3:PutObjectAcl"
                ],
                "Resource": [
                    "arn:aws:s3:::amzn-s3-demo-bucket/*"
                ],
                "Effect": "Allow",
                "Sid": "Stmt1234567891234"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
**Example 10: Granting permissions for an S3 object**
The following `cp` command illustrates the use of the `--grants` option to grant read access to all users identified by URI and full control to a specific user identified by their Canonical ID:

```
aws s3 cp {{file.txt}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/}} --grants {{read=uri=http://acs.amazonaws.com/groups/global/AllUsers}} {{full=id=79a59df900b949e55d96a1e698fbacedfd6e09d98eacf8f8d5218e7cd47ef2be}}
```
Output:

```
upload: file.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/file.txt
```
**Example 11: Uploading a local file stream to S3**
PowerShell may alter the encoding of or add a CRLF to piped input.
The following `cp` command uploads a local file stream from standard input to a specified bucket and key:

```

```
**Example 13: Downloading an S3 object as a local file stream**
PowerShell may alter the encoding of or add a CRLF to piped or redirected output.
The following `cp` command downloads an S3 object locally as a stream to standard output. Downloading as a stream is not currently compatible with the `--recursive` parameter:

```
aws s3 cp {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/stream.txt}} {{-}}
```
**Example 14: Uploading to an S3 access point**
The following `cp` command uploads a single file (`mydoc.txt`) to the access point (`myaccesspoint`) at the key (`mykey`):

```
aws s3 cp {{mydoc.txt}} {{s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey}}
```
Output:

```
upload: mydoc.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey
```
**Example 15: Downloading from an S3 access point**
The following `cp` command downloads a single object (`mykey`) from the access point (`myaccesspoint`) to the local file (`mydoc.txt`):

```
aws s3 cp {{s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey}} {{mydoc.txt}}
```
Output:

```
download: s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/mykey to mydoc.txt
```

### `ls`
<a name="s3_Ls_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `ls`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: Listing all user owned buckets**
The following `ls` command lists all of the buckets owned by the user. In this example, the user owns the buckets `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` and `amzn-s3-demo-bucket2`. The timestamp is the date the bucket was created, shown in your machine's time zone. This date can change when making changes to your bucket, such as editing its bucket policy. Note if `s3://` is used for the path argument `<S3Uri>`, it will list all of the buckets as well.

```
aws s3 ls
```
Output:

```
2013-07-11 17:08:50 amzn-s3-demo-bucket
2013-07-24 14:55:44 amzn-s3-demo-bucket2
```
**Example 2: Listing all prefixes and objects in a bucket**
The following `ls` command lists objects and common prefixes under a specified bucket and prefix. In this example, the user owns the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` with the objects `test.txt` and `somePrefix/test.txt`. The `LastWriteTime` and `Length` are arbitrary. Note that since the `ls` command has no interaction with the local filesystem, the `s3://` URI scheme is not required to resolve ambiguity and may be omitted.

```
aws s3 ls {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}}
```
Output:

```
                           PRE somePrefix/
2013-07-25 17:06:27         88 test.txt
```
**Example 3: Listing all prefixes and objects in a specific bucket and prefix**
The following `ls` command lists objects and common prefixes under a specified bucket and prefix. However, there are no objects nor common prefixes under the specified bucket and prefix.

```
aws s3 ls {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/noExistPrefix}}
```
Output:

```
None
```
**Example 4: Recursively listing all prefixes and objects in a bucket**
The following `ls` command will recursively list objects in a bucket. Rather than showing `PRE dirname/` in the output, all the content in a bucket will be listed in order.

```
aws s3 ls {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} \
    --recursive
```
Output:

```
2013-09-02 21:37:53         10 a.txt
2013-09-02 21:37:53    2863288 foo.zip

2013-09-02 21:32:57        398 z.txt
```
**Example 5: Summarizing all prefixes and objects in a bucket**
The following `ls` command demonstrates the same command using the --human-readable and --summarize options. --human-readable displays file size in Bytes/MiB/KiB/GiB/TiB/PiB/EiB. --summarize displays the total number of objects and total size at the end of the result listing:

```
aws s3 ls {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} \
    --recursive \
    --human-readable \
    --summarize
```
Output:

```
2013-09-02 21:37:53   10 Bytes a.txt
2013-09-02 21:37:53  2.9 MiB foo.zip
2013-09-02 21:32:57   23 Bytes foo/bar/.baz/a

2013-09-02 21:32:57  398 Bytes z.txt

Total Objects: 10
   Total Size: 2.9 MiB
```
**Example 6: Listing from an S3 access point**
The following `ls` command lists objects from access point (`myaccesspoint`):

```
aws s3 ls {{s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/}}
```
Output:

```
                           PRE somePrefix/
2013-07-25 17:06:27         88 test.txt

The following command applies a lifecycle configuration to the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`:

```
aws s3api put-bucket-lifecycle --bucket {{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} --lifecycle-configuration {{file://lifecycle.json}}
```
The file `lifecycle.json` is a JSON document in the current folder that specifies two rules:

```
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "Move to Glacier after sixty days (objects in logs/2015/)",
      "Prefix": "logs/2015/",
      "Status": "Enabled",
      "Transition": {
        "Days": 60,

      "Prefix": "logs/2014/",
      "Status": "Enabled"
    }
  ]
}
```
The first rule moves files to Amazon Glacier after sixty days. The second rule deletes files from Amazon S3 on the specified date. For information on acceptable timestamp formats, see Specifying Parameter Values in the *AWS CLI User Guide*.
Each rule in the above example specifies a policy (`Transition` or `Expiration`) and file prefix (folder name) to which it applies. You can also create a rule that applies to an entire bucket by specifying a blank prefix:

```
{
  "Rules": [
    {
      "ID": "Move to Glacier after sixty days (all objects in bucket)",
      "Prefix": "",
      "Status": "Enabled",

### `sync`
<a name="s3_Sync_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `sync`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: Sync all local objects to the specified bucket**
The following `sync` command syncs objects from a local directory to the specified prefix and bucket by uploading the local files to S3. A local file will require uploading if the size of the local file is different than the size of the S3 object, the last modified time of the local file is newer than the last modified time of the S3 object, or the local file does not exist under the specified bucket and prefix. In this example, the user syncs the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` to the local current directory. The local current directory contains the files `test.txt` and `test2.txt`. The bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` contains no objects.

```
aws s3 sync {{.}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}}
```
Output:

```
upload: test.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt
upload: test2.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt
```
**Example 2: Sync all S3 objects from the specified S3 bucket to another bucket**
The following `sync` command syncs objects under a specified prefix and bucket to objects under another specified prefix and bucket by copying S3 objects. An S3 object will require copying if the sizes of the two S3 objects differ, the last modified time of the source is newer than the last modified time of the destination, or the S3 object does not exist under the specified bucket and prefix destination.
In this example, the user syncs the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` to the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket2`. The bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` contains the objects `test.txt` and `test2.txt`. The bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket2` contains no objects:

```
aws s3 sync {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2}}
```
Output:

```
copy: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/test.txt
copy: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket2/test2.txt
```
**Example 3: Sync all S3 objects from the specified S3 bucket to the local directory**
The following `sync` command syncs files from the specified S3 bucket to the local directory by downloading S3 objects. An S3 object will require downloading if the size of the S3 object differs from the size of the local file, the last modified time of the S3 object is newer than the last modified time of the local file, or the S3 object does not exist in the local directory. Take note that when objects are downloaded from S3, the last modified time of the local file is changed to the last modified time of the S3 object. In this example, the user syncs the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` to the current local directory. The bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` contains the objects `test.txt` and `test2.txt`. The current local directory has no files:

```
aws s3 sync {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} {{.}}
```
Output:

```
download: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt to test.txt
download: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt to test2.txt
```
**Example 4: Sync all local objects to the specified bucket and delete all files that do not match**
The following `sync` command syncs objects under a specified prefix and bucket to files in a local directory by uploading the local files to S3. Because of the `--delete` parameter, any files existing under the specified prefix and bucket but not existing in the local directory will be deleted. In this example, the user syncs the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` to the local current directory. The local current directory contains the files `test.txt` and `test2.txt`. The bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` contains the object `test3.txt`:

```
aws s3 sync {{.}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} \
    --delete
```
Output:

```
upload: test.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test.txt
upload: test2.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt
delete: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test3.txt
```
**Example 5: Sync all local objects to the specified bucket except ``.jpg`` files**
The following `sync` command syncs objects under a specified prefix and bucket to files in a local directory by uploading the local files to S3. Because of the `--exclude` parameter, all files matching the pattern existing both in S3 and locally will be excluded from the sync. In this example, the user syncs the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` to the local current directory. The local current directory contains the files `test.jpg` and `test2.txt`. The bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` contains the object `test.jpg` of a different size than the local `test.jpg`:

```
aws s3 sync {{.}} {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} \
    --exclude {{"*.jpg"}}
```
Output:

```
upload: test2.txt to s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test2.txt
```
**Example 6: Sync all local objects to the specified bucket except specified directory files**
The following `sync` command syncs files under a local directory to objects under a specified prefix and bucket by downloading S3 objects. This example uses the `--exclude` parameter flag to exclude a specified directory and S3 prefix from the `sync` command. In this example, the user syncs the local current directory to the bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket`. The local current directory contains the files `test.txt` and `another/test2.txt`. The bucket `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` contains the objects `another/test5.txt` and `test1.txt`:

```
aws s3 sync {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/}} {{.}} \
    --exclude {{"*another/*"}}
```
Output:

```
download: s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/test1.txt to test1.txt
```
**Example 7: Sync all objects between buckets in different regions**
The following `sync` command syncs files between two buckets in different regions:

```
aws s3 sync {{s3://my-us-west-2-bucket}} {{s3://my-us-east-1-bucket}} \
    --source-region {{us-west-2}} \
    --region {{us-east-1}}
```
Output:

```
download: s3://my-us-west-2-bucket/test1.txt to s3://my-us-east-1-bucket/test1.txt
```
**Example 8: Sync to an S3 access point**
The following `sync` command syncs the current directory to the access point (`myaccesspoint`):

```
aws s3 sync {{.}} {{s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/}}
```
Output:

```
upload: test.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/test.txt
upload: test2.txt to s3://arn:aws:s3:us-west-2:123456789012:accesspoint/myaccesspoint/test2.txt
```

### `upload-part-copy`
<a name="s3_UploadPartCopy_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `upload-part-copy`.

**AWS CLI**
**To upload part of an object by copying data from an existing object as the data source**
The following `upload-part-copy` example uploads a part by copying data from an existing object as a data source.

```
aws s3api upload-part-copy \
    --bucket {{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} \
    --key {{"Map_Data_June.mp4"}} \
    --copy-source {{"amzn-s3-demo-bucket/copy_of_Map_Data_June.mp4"}} \
    --part-number {{1}} \
    --upload-id {{"bq0tdE1CDpWQYRPLHuNG50xAT6pA5D.m_RiBy0ggOH6b13pVRY7QjvLlf75iFdJqp_2wztk5hvpUM2SesXgrzbehG5hViyktrfANpAD0NO.Nk3XREBqvGeZF6U3ipiSm"}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "CopyPartResult": {
        "LastModified": "2019-12-13T23:16:03.000Z",
        "ETag": "\"711470fc377698c393d94aed6305e245\""
    }
}
```

### `upload-part`
<a name="s3_UploadPart_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `upload-part`.

**AWS CLI**
The following command uploads the first part in a multipart upload initiated with the `create-multipart-upload` command:

```
aws s3api upload-part --bucket {{amzn-s3-demo-bucket}} --key '{{multipart/01}}' --part-number {{1}} --body {{part01}} --upload-id  {{"dfRtDYU0WWCCcH43C3WFbkRONycyCpTJJvxu2i5GYkZljF.Yxwh6XG7WfS2vC4to6HiV6Yjlx.cph0gtNBtJ8P3URCSbB7rjxI5iEwVDmgaXZOGgkk5nVTW16HOQ5l0R"}}
```
The `body` option takes the name or path of a local file for upload (do not use the file:// prefix). The minimum part size is 5 MB. Upload ID is returned by `create-multipart-upload` and can also be retrieved with `list-multipart-uploads`. Bucket and key are specified when you create the multipart upload.
Output:

```
{
    "ETag": "\"e868e0f4719e394144ef36531ee6824c\""
}
```
Save the ETag value of each part for later. They are required to complete the multipart upload.

### `website`
<a name="s3_Website_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `website`.

**AWS CLI**
**Configure an S3 bucket as a static website**
The following command configures a bucket named `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` as a static website. The index document option specifies the file in `amzn-s3-demo-bucket` that visitors will be directed to when they navigate to the website URL. In this case, the bucket is in the us-west-2 region, so the site would appear at `http://amzn-s3-demo-bucket.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com`.
All files in the bucket that appear on the static site must be configured to allow visitors to open them. File permissions are configured separately from the bucket website configuration.

```
aws s3 website {{s3://amzn-s3-demo-bucket/}} \
    --index-document {{index.html}} \
    --error-document {{error.html}}
```
