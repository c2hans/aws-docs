# Amazon ECR Public examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_ecr-public_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with Amazon ECR Public.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

### `batch-delete-image`
<a name="ecr-public_BatchDeleteImage_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `batch-delete-image`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: To delete an image by using image digest ids, the image and all of its tags are deleted within a repository in a public registry**
The following `batch-delete-image` example deletes an image by specifying the image digest.:

```
aws ecr-public batch-delete-image \
    --repository-name {{project-a/nginx-web-app}} \
    --image-ids {{imageDigest=sha256:b1f9deb5fe3711a3278379ebbcaefbc5d70a2263135db86bd27a0dae150546c2}}
```
Output:

```
{
"imageIds": [
    {
        "imageDigest": "sha256:b1f9deb5fe3711a3278379ebbcaefbc5d70a2263135db86bd27a0dae150546c2",
        "imageTag": "latest"
    }
],
"failures": []
}
```
For more information, see [Deleting an image in a public repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-image-delete.html) in the *Amazon ECR Public User Guide*.
**Example 2: To delete any image by specifying the tag associated with the image you want to delete from the repository.**
The following `batch-delete-image` example deletes an image by specifying the tag associated with the image repository named `project-a/nginx-web-app` in a public registry. If you have only one tag and execute this command, it will remove the image. Otherwise, if you have multiple tags for the same image, specify one, and only the tag is removed from repository and not the image.

```
aws ecr-public batch-delete-image \
    --repository-name {{project-a/nginx-web-app}} \
    --image-ids {{imageTag=_temp}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "imageIds": [
        {
            "imageDigest": "sha256:f7a86a0760e2f8d7eff07e515fc87bf4bac45c35376c06f9a280f15ecad6d7e0",
            "imageTag": "_temp"
        }
    ],
    "failures": []
}
```
For more information, see [Deleting an image in a public repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/public/public-image-delete.html) in the *Amazon ECR Public User Guide*.
**Example 3: To delete multiple images, you can specify multiple image tags or image digests in the request for a repository in a public registry.**
The following `batch-delete-image` example delete multiple images from a repository named project-a/nginx-web-app by specifying multiple image tags or image digests in the request.

```
aws ecr-public batch-delete-image \
    --repository-name {{project-a/nginx-web-app}} \
    --image-ids {{imageTag=temp2.0}}  {{imageDigest=sha256:47ba980bc055353d9c0af89b1894f68faa43ca93856917b8406316be86f01278}}
```
Output:

```
{
     "imageIds": [
         {
             "imageDigest": "sha256:47ba980bc055353d9c0af89b1894f68faa43ca93856917b8406316be86f01278"
         },
         {
             "imageDigest": "sha256:f7a86a0760e2f8d7eff07e515fc87bf4bac45c35376c06f9a280f15ecad6d7e0",

 }
```

**Example 4: To delete an image in cross AWS Account using registry-id and imagedigest ids, the image and all of its tags are deleted within a repository in a public registry**
The following `batch-delete-image` example deletes an image by specifying the image digest in the cross AWS Account.:

```
aws ecr-public batch-delete-image \
    --registry-id {{123456789098}} \
    --repository-name {{project-a/nginx-web-app}} \
    --image-ids {{imageDigest=sha256:b1f9deb5fe3711a3278379ebbcaefbc5d70a2263135db86bd27a0dae150546c2}} \
    --region {{us-east-1}}
```
