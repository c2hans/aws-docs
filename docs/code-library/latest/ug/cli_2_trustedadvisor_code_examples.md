# Trusted Advisor examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_trustedadvisor_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with Trusted Advisor.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

```
aws trustedadvisor list-organization-recommendations \
    --pillar {{security}} \
    --max-items {{100}}
```
Output:

```
