# AWS CodeConnections examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_codestar-connections_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with AWS CodeConnections.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

### `create-connection`
<a name="codestar-connections_CreateConnection_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-connection`.

**AWS CLI**
**To create a connection**
The following `create-connection` example shows how to create a connection to a third-party repository. This example creates a connection where the third-party provider is Bitbucket.
A connection created through the AWS CLI or AWS CloudFormation is in Pending status by default. After you create a connection with the CLI or AWS CloudFormation, use the console to edit the connection to make its status Available.

```
aws codestar-connections create-connection \
    --provider-type {{Bitbucket}} \
    --connection-name {{MyConnection}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "ConnectionArn": "arn:aws:codestar-connections:us-east-1:123456789012:connection/aEXAMPLE-8aad-4d5d-8878-dfcab0bc441f"
}
```

```
aws codestar-connections create-host \
    --name {{MyHost}} \
    --provider-type {{GitHubEnterpriseServer}} \
