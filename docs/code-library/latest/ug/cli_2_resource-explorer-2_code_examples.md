# Resource Explorer examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_resource-explorer-2_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with Resource Explorer.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

### `associate-default-view`
<a name="resource-explorer-2_AssociateDefaultView_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `associate-default-view`.

**AWS CLI**
**To set a Resource Explorer view as the default for its AWS Region**
The following `associate-default-view` example sets a view, as specified by its ARN, to be the default view for the AWS Region in which you call the operation.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 associate-default-view \
    --view-arn {{arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/My-Main-View/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111}}
```
Output:

    --view-arns {{arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/My-EC2-Only-View/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222,}} \
                {{arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/My-Main-View/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111}}
```
Output:

```

        {
            "Filters": {

### `create-index`
<a name="resource-explorer-2_CreateIndex_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-index`.

**AWS CLI**
**To turn on Resource Explorer in an AWS Region by creating an index**
The following `create-index` example creates a local index in the AWS Region in which the operation is called. The AWS CLI automatically generates a random `client-token` parameter value and includes it in the call to AWS if you don't specify a value.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 create-index \
    --region {{us-east-1}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "Arn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222c",
    "CreatedAt": "2022-11-01T20:00:59.149Z",
    "State": "CREATING"
}
```
After you create a local index, you can convert it into the aggregator index for the account by running the [update-index-type](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/resource-explorer-2/update-index-type.html) command.
For more information, see [Turning on Resource Explorer in an AWS Region to index your resources](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/resource-explorer/latest/userguide/manage-service-register.html) in the *AWS Resource Explorer Users Guide*.
+  For API details, see [CreateIndex](https://awscli.amazonaws.com/v2/documentation/api/latest/reference/resource-explorer-2/create-index.html) in *AWS CLI Command Reference*.

### `create-view`
<a name="resource-explorer-2_CreateView_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-view`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: To create an unfiltered view for the index in an AWS Region**
The following `create-view` example creates a view in the specified AWS Region that returns all results in the Region without any filtering. The view includes the optional Tags field on returned results. Because this view is created in the Region that contains the aggregator index, it can include results from all Regions in the account that contain a Resource Explorer index.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 create-view \
    --view-name {{My-Main-View}} \
    --included-properties {{Name=tags}} \
    --region {{us-east-1}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "View": {
        "Filters": {
            "FilterString": ""
        },
        "IncludedProperties": [
            {
                "Name": "tags"
            }
        ],
        "LastUpdatedAt": "2022-07-13T20:34:11.314000+00:00",
        "Owner": "123456789012",
        "Scope": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root",
        "ViewArn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/My-Main-View/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111"
    }
}
```
**Example 2: To create a view that returns only resources associated with Amazon EC2**
The following `create-view` creates a view in AWS Region `us-east-1` that returns only those resources in the Region that are associated with the Amazon EC2 service. The view includes the optional `Tags` field on returned results. Because this view is created in the Region that contains the aggregator index, it can include results from all Regions in the account that contain a Resource Explorer index.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 create-view \
    --view-name {{My-EC2-Only-View}} \
    --included-properties {{Name=tags}} \
    --filters FilterString="service:ec2" \
    --region {{us-east-1}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "View": {
        "Filters": {
            "FilterString": "service:ec2"
        },
        "IncludedProperties": [
            {
                "Name":"tags"
            }
        ],
        "LastUpdatedAt": "2022-07-13T21:35:09.059Z",
        "Owner": "123456789012",
        "Scope": "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root",
        "ViewArn": "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/My-EC2-Only-View/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222"
    }
}
```

**AWS CLI**
**To turn off Resource Explorer in an AWS Region by deleting its index**
The following `delete-index` example deletes the specified Resource Explorer index in the AWS Region in which you make the request.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 delete-index \
    --arn {{arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-west-2:123456789012:index/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222}} \
    --region {{us-west-2}}

The following code example shows how to use `get-index`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: To retrieve the details for a Resource Explorer aggregator index**
The following `get-index` example displays the details for the Resource Explorer index in the specified AWS Region. Because the specified Region contains the aggregator index for the account, the output lists the Regions that replicate data into this Region's index.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 get-index \
    --region {{us-east-1}}
```
Output:

### `list-tags-for-resource`
<a name="resource-explorer-2_ListTagsForResource_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `list-tags-for-resource`.

**AWS CLI**
**To list the tags attached to a Resource Explorer view or index**
The following `list-tags-for-resource` example lists the tag key and value pairs attached to view with the specified ARN. You must call the operation from the AWS Region that contains the resource.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 list-tags-for-resource \
    --resource-arn {{arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/My-View/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "Tags": {
        "application": "MainCorpApp",
        "department": "1234"
    }
}
```

**AWS CLI**
**To list the Resource Explorer views available in an AWS Region**
The following `list-views` example lists all of the views available in the Region in which you invoke the operation.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 list-views
```
Output:

```
{
    "Views": [
        "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/EC2-Only-View/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE11111",
        "arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/Default-All-Resources-View/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222",

### `search`
<a name="resource-explorer-2_Search_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `search`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example 1: To search using the default view**
The following `search` example displays all resources in the specified Region that are associated with the IAM service. The search uses the default view for the Region. The example response includes a `NextToken` value, which indicates that there is more output available to retrieve with additional calls.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 search \
    --query-string {{"service:iam"}}
```
Output:

```

}
```
**Example 2: To search using a specified view**
The following `search` example search displays all resources ("\*") in the specified AWS Region that are visible through the specified view. The results include only resources associated with Amazon EC2 because of the filters attached to the view.

```
aws resource-explorer-2 search \
    --query-string {{"*"}} \
    --view-arn {{arn:aws:resource-explorer-2:us-east-1:123456789012:view/My-EC2-view/EXAMPLE8-90ab-cdef-fedc-EXAMPLE22222}}
