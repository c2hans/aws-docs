# Amazon GameLift Servers examples using AWS CLI
<a name="cli_2_gamelift_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS Command Line Interface with Amazon GameLift Servers.

*Actions* are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. While actions show you how to call individual service functions, you can see actions in context in their related scenarios.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.

### `create-build`
<a name="gamelift_CreateBuild_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-build`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example1: To create a game build from files in an S3 bucket**
The following `create-build` example creates a custom game build resource. It uses zipped files that are stored in an S3 location in an AWS account that you control. This example assumes that you've already created an IAM role that gives Amazon GameLift permission to access the S3 location. Since the request does not specify an operating system, the new build resource defaults to WINDOWS\_2012.

```
aws gamelift create-build \
    --storage-location {{file://storage-loc.json}} \
    --name {{MegaFrogRaceServer.NA}} \
    --build-version {{12345.678}}
```
Contents of `storage-loc.json`:

```
{
    "Bucket":"MegaFrogRaceServer_NA_build_files"
    "Key":"MegaFrogRaceServer_build_123.zip"
    "RoleArn":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/gamelift"
}
```
Output:

```
{
    "Build": {
        "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
        "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
        "CreationTime": 1496708916.18,
        "Name": "MegaFrogRaceServer.NA",
        "OperatingSystem": "WINDOWS_2012",

        "Bucket": "MegaFrogRaceServer_NA_build_files",
        "Key": "MegaFrogRaceServer_build_123.zip"
    }
}
```
**Example2: To create a game build resource for manually uploading files to GameLift**
The following `create-build` example creates a new build resource. It also gets a storage location and temporary credentials that allow you to manually upload your game build to the GameLift location in Amazon S3. Once you've successfully uploaded your build, the GameLift service validates the build and updates the new build's status.

```
aws gamelift create-build \
    --name {{MegaFrogRaceServer.NA}} \
    --build-version {{12345.678}} \
    --operating-system {{AMAZON_LINUX}}
```
Output:

```

### `create-game-session-queue`
<a name="gamelift_CreateGameSessionQueue_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `create-game-session-queue`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example1: To set up an ordered game session queue**
The following `create-game-session-queue` example creates a new game session queue with destinations in two regions. It also configures the queue so that game session requests time out after waiting 10 minutes for placement. Since no latency policies are defined, GameLift attempts to place all game sessions with the first destination listed.

```
aws gamelift create-game-session-queue \
    --name {{MegaFrogRaceServer-NA}} \
    --destinations {{file://destinations.json}} \
    --timeout-in-seconds {{600}}
```
Contents of `destinations.json`:

```
{
    "Destinations": [
        {"DestinationArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" },
        {"DestinationArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-1::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222" }
    ]
}
```
Output:

```
{
    "GameSessionQueues": [
        {
            "Name": "MegaFrogRaceServer-NA",
            "GameSessionQueueArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2:123456789012:gamesessionqueue/MegaFrogRaceServer-NA",
            "TimeoutInSeconds": 600,
            "Destinations": [
                {"DestinationArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111"},
                {"DestinationArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-1::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222"}
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```
**Example2: To set up a game session queue with player latency policies**
The following `create-game-session-queue` example creates a new game session queue with two player latency policies. The first policy sets a 100ms latency cap that is enforced during the first minute of a game session placement attempt. The second policy raises the latency cap to 200ms until the placement request times out at 3 minutes.

```
aws gamelift create-game-session-queue \
    --name {{MegaFrogRaceServer-NA}} \
    --destinations {{file://destinations.json}} \
    --player-latency-policies {{file://latency-policies.json}} \
    --timeout-in-seconds {{180}}
```
Contents of `destinations.json`:

```
{
    "Destinations": [
        { "DestinationArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111" },
        { "DestinationArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-east-1::fleet/fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222" }
    ]
}
```
Contents of `latency-policies.json`:

```
{
    "PlayerLatencyPolicies": [
        {"MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds": 200},
        {"MaximumIndividualPlayerLatencyMilliseconds": 100, "PolicyDurationSeconds": 60}
    ]

### `list-builds`
<a name="gamelift_ListBuilds_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `list-builds`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example1: To get a list of custom game builds**
The following `list-builds` example retrieves properties for all game server builds in the current Region. The sample request illustrates how to use the pagination parameters, `Limit` and `NextToken`, to retrieve the results in sequential sets. The first command retrieves the first two builds. Because there are more than two available, the response includes a `NextToken` to indicate that more results are available.

```
aws gamelift list-builds \
    --limit {{2}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "Builds": [
        {
            "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
            "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
            "CreationTime": 1495664528.723,
            "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_One",
            "OperatingSystem": "WINDOWS_2012",
            "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
            "Status": "READY",
            "Version": "12345.678"
        },
        {
            "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
            "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
            "CreationTime": 1495528748.555,
            "Name": "My_Game_Server_Build_Two",
            "OperatingSystem": "AMAZON_LINUX_2",
            "SizeOnDisk": 8567781,
            "Status": "FAILED",
            "Version": "23456.789"
        }
    ],
    "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE="
}
```
You can then call the command again with the `--next-token` parameter as follows to see the next two builds.

```
aws gamelift list-builds \
    --limit {{2}}
    --next-token {{eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE=}}
```
Repeat until the response doesn't include a `NextToken` value.
**Example2: To get a list of custom game builds in failure status**
The following `list-builds` example retrieves properties for all game server builds in the current region that currently have status FAILED.

```
aws gamelift list-builds \
    --status {{FAILED}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "Builds": [
        {
            "BuildArn": "arn:aws:gamelift:us-west-2::build/build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
            "BuildId": "build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",

### `list-fleets`
<a name="gamelift_ListFleets_cli_2_topic"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `list-fleets`.

**AWS CLI**
**Example1: To get a list of all fleets in a Region**
The following `list-fleets` example displays the fleet IDs of all fleets in the current Region. This example uses pagination parameters to retrieve two fleet IDs at a time. The response includes a `next-token` attribute, which indicates that there are more results to retrieve.

```
aws gamelift list-fleets \
    --limit {{2}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "FleetIds": [
        "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111",
        "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222"
    ],
    "NextToken": "eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC01NWYxZTZmMS1jY2FlLTQ3YTctOWI5ZS1iYjFkYTQwMjJEXAMPLE="
}
```
You can pass the `NextToken` value from the previous response in the next command, as shown here to get the next two results.

```
aws gamelift list-fleets \
    --limit {{2}} \
    --next-token {{eyJhd3NBY2NvdW50SWQiOnsicyI6IjMwMjc3NjAxNjM5OCJ9LCJidWlsZElkIjp7InMiOiJidWlsZC00NDRlZjQxZS1hM2I1LTQ2NDYtODJmMy0zYzI4ZTgxNjVjEXAMPLE=}}
```
**Example2: To get a list of all fleets in a Region with a specific build or script**
The following `list-builds` example retrieves the IDs of fleets that are deployed with the specified game build. If you're working with Realtime Servers, you can provide a script ID in place of a build ID. Because this example does not specify the limit parameter, the results can include up to 16 fleet IDs.

```
aws gamelift list-fleets \
    --build-id {{build-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE11111}}
```
Output:

```
{
    "FleetIds": [
        "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE22222",
        "fleet-a1b2c3d4-5678-90ab-cdef-EXAMPLE33333",
