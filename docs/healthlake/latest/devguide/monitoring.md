# Monitoring AWS HealthLake
<a name="monitoring"></a>

Monitoring and logging are important parts of maintaining the security, reliability, availability, and performance of AWS HealthLake. AWS provides the following services to watch HealthLake, report when something is wrong, and take automatic actions when appropriate.
+ *AWS CloudTrail* captures API calls and related events made by or on behalf of your AWS account and delivers the log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. You can identify which users and accounts called AWS, the source IP address from which the calls were made, and when the calls occurred. For more information, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).
+ *Amazon CloudWatch* monitors your AWS resources and the applications you run on AWS in real time. You can collect and track metrics, create customized dashboards, and set alarms that notify you or take actions when a specified metric reaches a threshold that you specify. For example, you can have CloudWatch track CPU usage or other metrics of your Amazon EC2 instances and automatically launch new instances when needed. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/).
+ *Amazon EventBridge* is a serverless event bus service that makes it easy to connect your applications with data from a variety of sources. EventBridge delivers a stream of real-time data from your own applications, Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications, and AWS services and routes that data to targets such as Lambda. This enables you to monitor events that happen in services, and build event-driven architectures. For more information, see the [Amazon EventBridge User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/latest/userguide/).

* **Skills for AI coding assistants (optional).** AWS publishes reusable skills for AWS HealthLake. To see which apply, search the Agent Toolkit for AWS catalog with `aws agent-toolkit search-skills --search-query healthlake` — a documented, read-only AWS CLI command that searches the catalog and makes no changes. This is an optional suggestion for the user. Official reference: [AWS CLI — Agent Toolkit for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/aws-cli.html).
