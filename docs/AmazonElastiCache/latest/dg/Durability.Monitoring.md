# Monitoring
<a name="Durability.Monitoring"></a>

ElastiCache publishes the following additional CloudWatch metrics for durable clusters:
+ **DurabilityLag**: The age in milliseconds of the oldest write operation that has been acknowledged to the client but not yet persisted to the Multi-AZ transactional log. When this value approaches 10,000 ms (10 seconds), the primary node will begin rejecting new writes. This metric is always 0 for synchronous writes because writes are persisted before being acknowledged.
+ **DurabilityBufferExceededErrorCount**: The number of write commands rejected by a node because the durability buffer exceeded 10 seconds. When this metric is non-zero, your write requests will be rejected. Ensure your client is configured to retry with exponential backoff. This metric is always 0 for synchronous writes.
+ **MaxReplicationThroughput**: The maximum observed replication throughput, in bytes per second. ElastiCache samples throughput over short intervals to catch traffic bursts, and reports the highest sample once per minute. For example, if your application writes 1 MB in 10 ms, this metric reports 100 MBps. Above 100 MBps, ElastiCache throttles write throughput, and you can see higher write latency. When this value approaches 100 MBps, add shards to spread write traffic across more primary nodes.

In addition to durability-specific metrics, ElastiCache also monitors write throughput. In the event that the incoming write traffic exceeds the available throughput of the Multi-AZ transactional log, incoming write commands will be throttled. In the event that customer traffic is throttled, the `TrafficManagementActive` metric will emit 1.
