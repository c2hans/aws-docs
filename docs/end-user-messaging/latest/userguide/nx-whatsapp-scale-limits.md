# Limits and quotas
<a name="nx-whatsapp-scale-limits"></a>

WhatsApp messaging is subject to two kinds of limits: the per-account service quotas that AWS End User Messaging applies, and the messaging limits and quality rules that Meta applies to your WhatsApp Business Account (WABA). Both affect how much you can send, so plan for both when you scale.

## AWS End User Messaging service quotas

AWS End User Messaging applies per-account quotas to the resources and send rates that support WhatsApp messaging. For the account-level quotas that apply across channels, and how to request an increase, see [Quotas](nx-features-quotas.md).

## WhatsApp messaging limits and quality tiers
<a name="nx-whatsapp-scale-limits-meta"></a>

Meta applies a messaging limit to your WhatsApp Business Account that caps how many unique recipients you can start conversations with in a rolling period. Meta also assigns a quality rating to each of your phone numbers based on how recipients respond to your messages, such as blocking or reporting them. Your messaging limit can increase as you send high-quality messages to engaged recipients, and it can decrease, or your number can be restricted, if your quality rating falls. These limits and ratings are managed by Meta, not by AWS End User Messaging, so follow the practices in [Best practices](nx-whatsapp-scale-best-practices.md) to protect them.

Because Meta owns these limits and updates them over time, AWS End User Messaging does not restate the values here. For the current messaging limit tiers, the thresholds that move you between them, and the quality rating states that affect them, see Meta's [Quality Rating and Messaging Limits](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/api/rate-limits/) documentation.

## Template limits
<a name="nx-whatsapp-scale-limits-template"></a>

WhatsApp business messaging is template-first: you open a conversation with an approved template, and Meta reviews each template before you can use it. Meta applies limits to the number of templates on a WABA and to how templates are categorized and reviewed. For how to create and manage templates, see [WhatsApp Message Templates](nx-features-whatsapp-templates.md).

These limits are set and updated by Meta, so AWS End User Messaging does not restate the values here. For the current number of templates allowed per WABA, and the rules for how templates are categorized and reviewed, see Meta's [Message templates](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/whatsapp/business-management-api/message-templates/) documentation.
