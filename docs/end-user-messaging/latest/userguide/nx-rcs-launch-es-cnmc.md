# CNMC National Alias Registry requirement
<a name="nx-rcs-launch-es-cnmc"></a>

**Important**
All RCS agents used to send messages to Spanish mobile numbers (\+34) must be registered in the CNMC (Comision Nacional de los Mercados y la Competencia) National Alias Registry. This is the same regulatory body that governs SMS sender ID registration in Spain.

The CNMC registration process for RCS follows the same general pattern as SMS sender ID registration in Spain: obtain a qualifying digital certificate, register your RCS agent name in the National Alias Registry on the CNMC portal at [https://tramites.cnmc.gob.es/formulario/213/](https://tramites.cnmc.gob.es/formulario/213/), approve the CNMC verification email within 10 business days, and then submit your RCS country launch registration in the AWS End User Messaging console. For detailed instructions on the CNMC registration process, see [Spain registration](nx-country-reg-es.md).

**Note**
If you do not have a qualifying digital certificate or a representative in Spain or a qualifying EU country, you must appoint one. The representative must hold a valid digital certificate and have an apostilled notarized power of attorney authorizing them to act on your behalf. We recommend engaging legal counsel to advise on this process.

**Important**
We are currently processing new information about the specific field values customers need to enter on the CNMC portal for RCS agent registrations. We will update this documentation as soon as we have concrete details. This does not affect your ability to submit a Spain RCS country launch registration in the AWS End User Messaging console.

For general compliance guidance that applies to all countries, see [How to get set up](nx-rcs-get-set-up.md).
