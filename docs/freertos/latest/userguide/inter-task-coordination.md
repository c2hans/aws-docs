## Queues
<a name="inter-task-queues"></a>

Queues are the primary form of intertask communication. They can be used to send messages between tasks and between interrupts and tasks. In most cases, they are used as thread-safe, First In First Out (FIFO) buffers with new data being sent to the back of the queue. (Data can also be sent to the front of the queue.) Messages are sent through queues by copy, meaning the data (which can be a pointer to larger buffers) is itself copied into the queue rather than simply storing a reference to the data.

Queue APIs permit a block time to be specified. When a task attempts to read from an empty queue, the task is placed into the Blocked state until data becomes available on the queue or the block time elapses. Tasks in the Blocked state do not consume any CPU time, allowing other tasks to run. Similarly, when a task attempts to write to a full queue, the task is placed into the Blocked state until space becomes available in the queue or the block time elapses. If more than one task blocks on the same queue, the task with the highest priority is unblocked first.

Other FreeRTOS primitives, such as direct-to-task notifications and stream and message buffers, offer lightweight alternatives to queues in many common design scenarios.

## Semaphores and mutexes
<a name="inter-task-semaphones"></a>

The FreeRTOS kernel provides binary semaphores, counting semaphores, and mutexes for both mutual exclusion and synchronization purposes.

Binary semaphores can only have two values. They are a good choice for implementing synchronization (either between tasks or between tasks and an interrupt). Counting semaphores take more than two values. They allow many tasks to share resources or perform more complex synchronization operations.

Mutexes are binary semaphores that include a priority inheritance mechanism. This means that if a high priority task blocks while attempting to obtain a mutex that is currently held by a lower priority task, the priority of the task holding the token is temporarily raised to that of the blocking task. This mechanism is designed to ensure the higher priority task is kept in the Blocked state for the shortest time possible, to minimize the priority inversion that has occurred.

## Direct-to-task notifications
<a name="direct-task-notifications"></a>

Task notifications allow tasks to interact with other tasks, and to synchronize with interrupt service routines (ISRs), without the need for a separate communication object like a semaphore. Each RTOS task has a 32-bit notification value that is used to store the content of the notification, if any. An RTOS task notification is an event sent directly to a task that can unblock the receiving task and optionally update the receiving task's notification value.

RTOS task notifications can be used as a faster and lightweight alternative to binary and counting semaphores and, in some cases, queues. Task notifications have both speed and RAM footprint advantages over other FreeRTOS features that can be used to perform equivalent functionality. However, task notifications can only be used when there is only one task that can be the recipient of the event.

## Stream buffers
<a name="rtos-stream-buffer"></a>

Stream buffers allow a stream of bytes to be passed from an interrupt service routine to a task, or from one task to another. A byte stream can be of arbitrary length and does not necessarily have a beginning or an end. Any number of bytes can be written at one time, and any number of bytes can be read at one time. You enable stream buffer functionality by including the `stream_buffer.c` source file in your project.

Stream buffers assume there is only one task or interrupt that writes to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or interrupt that reads from the buffer (the reader). It is safe for the writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupt service routines, but it is not safe to have multiple writers or readers.

The stream buffer implementation uses direct-to-task notifications. Therefore, calling a stream buffer API that places the calling task into the Blocked state can change the calling task's notification state and value.

### Sending data
<a name="rtos-stream-buffer-send"></a>

`xStreamBufferSend()` is used to send data to a stream buffer in a task. `xStreamBufferSendFromISR()` is used to send data to a stream buffer in an interrupt service routine (ISR).

`xStreamBufferSend()` allows a block time to be specified. If `xStreamBufferSend()` is called with a non-zero block time to write to a stream buffer and the buffer is full, the task is placed into the Blocked state until space becomes available or the block time expires.

`sbSEND_COMPLETED()` and `sbSEND_COMPLETED_FROM_ISR()` are macros that are called (internally, by the FreeRTOS API) when data is written to a stream buffer. It takes the handle of the stream buffer that was updated. Both of these macros check to see if there is a task blocked on the stream buffer waiting for data, and if so, removes the task from the Blocked state.

You can change this default behavior by providing your own implementation of `sbSEND_COMPLETED()` in [`FreeRTOSConfig.h`](freertos-config.md). This is useful when a stream buffer is used to pass data between cores on a multicore processor. In that scenario, `sbSEND_COMPLETED()` can be implemented to generate an interrupt in the other CPU core, and the interrupt's service routine can then use the `xStreamBufferSendCompletedFromISR()` API to check, and if necessary unblock, a task that is waiting for the data.

### Receiving data
<a name="rtos-stream-buffer-receive"></a>

`xStreamBufferReceive()` is used to read data from a stream buffer in a task. `xStreamBufferReceiveFromISR()` is used to read data from a stream buffer in an interrupt service routine (ISR).

`xStreamBufferReceive()` allows a block time to be specified. If `xStreamBufferReceive()` is called with a non-zero block time to read from a stream buffer and the buffer is empty, the task is placed into the Blocked state until either a specified amount of data becomes available in the stream buffer, or the block time expires.

The amount of data that must be in the stream buffer before a task is unblocked is called the stream buffer's trigger level. A task blocked with a trigger level of 10 is unblocked when at least 10 bytes are written to the buffer or the task's block time expires. If a reading task's block time expires before the trigger level is reached, the task receives any data written to the buffer. The trigger level of a task must be set to a value between 1 and the size of the stream buffer. The trigger level of a stream buffer is set when `xStreamBufferCreate()` is called. It can be changed by calling `xStreamBufferSetTriggerLevel()`.

`sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED()` and `sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED_FROM_ISR()` are macros that are called (internally, by the FreeRTOS API) when data is read from a stream buffer. The macros check to see if there is a task blocked on the stream buffer waiting for space to become available within the buffer, and if so, they remove the task from the Blocked state. You can change the default behavior of `sbRECEIVE_COMPLETED()` by providing an alternative implementation in [`FreeRTOSConfig.h`](freertos-config.md).

## Message buffers
<a name="rtos-message-buffer"></a>

Message buffers allow variable-length discrete messages to be passed from an interrupt service routine to a task, or from one task to another. For example, messages of length 10, 20, and 123 bytes can all be written to, and read from, the same message buffer. A 10-byte message can only be read as a 10-byte message, not as individual bytes. Message buffers are built on top of stream buffer implementation. you can enable message buffer functionality by including the `stream_buffer.c` source file in your project.

Message buffers assume there is only one task or interrupt that writes to the buffer (the writer), and only one task or interrupt that reads from the buffer (the reader). It is safe for the writer and reader to be different tasks or interrupt service routines, but it is not safe to have multiple writers or readers.

The message buffer implementation uses direct-to-task notifications. Therefore, calling a stream buffer API that places the calling task into the Blocked state can change the calling task's notification state and value.

To enable message buffers to handle variable-sized messages, the length of each message is written into the message buffer before the message itself. The length is stored in a variable of type `size_t`, which is typically 4 bytes on a 32-byte architecture. Therefore, writing a 10-byte message into a message buffer actually consumes 14 bytes of buffer space. Likewise, writing a 100-byte message into a message buffer actually uses 104 bytes of buffer space.

### Sending data
<a name="rtos-message-buffer-send"></a>

`xMessageBufferSend()` is used to send data to a message buffer from a task. `xMessageBufferSendFromISR()` is used to send data to a message buffer from an interrupt service routine (ISR).

`xMessageBufferSend()` allows a block time to be specified. If `xMessageBufferSend()` is called with a non-zero block time to write to a message buffer and the buffer is full, the task is placed into the Blocked state until either space becomes available in the message buffer, or the block time expires.

`sbSEND_COMPLETED()` and `sbSEND_COMPLETED_FROM_ISR()` are macros that are called (internally, by the FreeRTOS API) when data is written to a stream buffer. It takes a single parameter, which is the handle of the stream buffer that was updated. Both of these macros check to see if there is a task blocked on the stream buffer waiting for data, and if so, they remove the task from the Blocked state.

You can change this default behavior by providing your own implementation of `sbSEND_COMPLETED()` in [`FreeRTOSConfig.h`](freertos-config.md). This is useful when a stream buffer is used to pass data between cores on a multicore processor. In that scenario, `sbSEND_COMPLETED()` can be implemented to generate an interrupt in the other CPU core, and the interrupt's service routine can then use the `xStreamBufferSendCompletedFromISR()` API to check, and if necessary unblock, a task that was waiting for the data.
