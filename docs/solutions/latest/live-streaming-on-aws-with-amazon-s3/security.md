# Security
<a name="security"></a>

When you build systems on AWS infrastructure, security responsibilities are shared between you and AWS. This [shared responsibility model](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/shared-responsibility-model/) reduces your operational burden because AWS operates, manages, and controls the components including the host operating system, the virtualization layer, and the physical security of the facilities in which the services operate. For more information about AWS security, visit [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/).

## IAM roles
<a name="iam-roles"></a>

IAM roles allow customers to assign granular access policies and permissions to services and users on the AWS Cloud. This solution creates IAM roles that grant the solution’s AWS Lambda functions access to create Regional resources.

## Amazon CloudFront
<a name="amazon-cloudfront"></a>

This solution deploys a static website [hosted](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html) in an Amazon S3 bucket. To help reduce latency and improve security, this solution includes an Amazon CloudFront distribution with an origin access identity, which is a CloudFront user that helps restrict access to the solution’s website bucket contents. For more information, see [Restricting Access to Amazon S3 Content by Using an Origin Access Identity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudFront/latest/DeveloperGuide/private-content-restricting-access-to-s3.html) in the *Amazon CloudFront Developer Guide*.
