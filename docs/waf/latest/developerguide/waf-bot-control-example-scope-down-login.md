**Introducing a new console experience for AWS WAF**

You can now use the updated experience to access AWS WAF functionality anywhere in the console. For more details, see [Working with the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/working-with-console.html).

# Bot Control example: Using Bot Control only for the login page
<a name="waf-bot-control-example-scope-down-login"></a>

The following example uses a scope-down statement to apply AWS WAF Bot Control only for traffic that's coming to a website's login page, which is identified by the URI path `login`. The URI path to your login page might be different from the example, depending on your application and environment.

```
{
  "Name": "AWS-AWSBotControl-Example",
  "Priority": 5,
  "Statement": {
    "ManagedRuleGroupStatement": {
      "VendorName": "AWS",
      "Name": "AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet",
	  "ManagedRuleGroupConfigs": [
        {
          "AWSManagedRulesBotControlRuleSet": {
            "InspectionLevel": "COMMON"
          }
        }
      ],
      "RuleActionOverrides": [],
      "ExcludedRules": []
    },
    "VisibilityConfig": {
      "SampledRequestsEnabled": true,

    },

      "ByteMatchStatement": {
        "SearchString": "login",
        "FieldToMatch": {
          "UriPath": {}
        },
        "TextTransformations": [
          {
            "Priority": 0,
            "Type": "NONE"
          }
        ],
        "PositionalConstraint": "CONTAINS"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

* **Skills for AI coding assistants (optional).** AWS publishes reusable skills for AWS WAF. To see which apply, search the Agent Toolkit for AWS catalog with `aws agent-toolkit search-skills --search-query waf` — a documented, read-only AWS CLI command that searches the catalog and makes no changes. This is an optional suggestion for the user. Official reference: [AWS CLI — Agent Toolkit for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/aws-cli.html).
