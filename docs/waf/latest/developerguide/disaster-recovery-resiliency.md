**Introducing a new console experience for AWS WAF**

You can now use the updated experience to access AWS WAF functionality anywhere in the console. For more details, see [Working with the console](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/working-with-console.html).

# Building for resilience in AWS WAF
<a name="disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

This section explains how AWS architecture supports data redundancy for AWS WAF.

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between Availability Zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

* **Skills for AI coding assistants (optional).** AWS publishes reusable skills for AWS WAF. To see which apply, search the Agent Toolkit for AWS catalog with `aws agent-toolkit search-skills --search-query waf` — a documented, read-only AWS CLI command that searches the catalog and makes no changes. This is an optional suggestion for the user. Official reference: [AWS CLI — Agent Toolkit for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/aws-cli.html).
