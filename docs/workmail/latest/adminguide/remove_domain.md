<a name="remove_domain"></a>

When you no longer need a domain, you can delete it. However, you must first delete any individuals or groups that use the domain as their email address.

**To remove a domain**

   If necessary, change the AWS Region. In the bar at the top of the console window, open the **Select a Region** list and choose a Region. For more information, see [Region Name and endpoints](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/index.html?rande.html) in the *Amazon Web Services General Reference*.

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Organizations**, and then choose the name of your organization.

1. In the list of domains, select the check box next to the domain name and choose **Remove**.

1. In the **Remove domain** dialog box, enter the name of the domain to remove and choose **Remove**.
