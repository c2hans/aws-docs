# URL and domain category filtering in Suricata compatible AWS Network Firewall rule groups
<a name="rule-groups-url-filtering"></a>

With URL and domain category filtering, you can filter network traffic based on predefined content categories. You can use this feature with **Suricata compatible rule strings** and **standard Network Firewall stateful rule groups**.

Network Firewall provides two filtering keywords:
+ `aws_url_category` - Evaluates complete URLs and domains in HTTP/HTTPS traffic
+ `aws_domain_category` - Evaluates only domain information from TLS SNI or HTTP host headers

To use URL and domain category filtering, you provide either the `aws_url_category` or `aws_domain_category` keyword followed by the category you want to filter for, for example `aws_url_category:Malicious;` You can specify multiple categories per rule. For additional examples, see [Stateful rules examples: URL/domain category filter](suricata-examples.md#suricata-example-rule-with-url-filter).

**How URL and domain category filtering works**

**aws\_url\_category keyword**
+ Supported protocol in rules: HTTP
+ Traffic handling:
  + **For HTTP traffic** - Evaluates complete URLs
  + **For HTTPS traffic** - Requires TLS inspection to evaluate URLs. Without TLS inspection, HTTPS traffic is treated as encrypted TLS traffic and cannot be evaluated
+ Performs evaluation in the following order:
  + Complete URL path evaluation (up to 30 recursive path lookups)
  + If no match is found, falls back to domain-level evaluation (up to 10 recursive subdomain lookups)
+ Matches against:
  + URI field from HTTP request headers (requires TLS inspection for HTTPS traffic)
  + Host field from HTTP request headers

**aws\_domain\_category keyword**
+ Supported protocols in rules: TLS, HTTP
+ Traffic handling:
  + **For HTTP traffic** - Evaluates domain from Host field
  + **For TLS traffic** - Evaluates domain from SNI field
  + No TLS inspection required
+ Performs domain-level evaluation:
  + Evaluates only domain-level information (up to 10 recursive subdomain lookups)
+ Matches against:
  + Server Name Indication (SNI) field from TLS handshake
  + Host field from HTTP request headers

**Considerations**

+ [TLS inspection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/network-firewall/latest/developerguide/tls-inspection-configurations.html) must be enabled on your firewall to perform URL category filtering on HTTPS traffic
+ Without TLS inspection, only domain-level filtering is possible for encrypted traffic
+ A single URL might map to multiple categories
+ Category database is automatically maintained and updated
+ You can specify multiple categories in a single rule
+ You cannot combine URL/domain category filtering keywords (`aws_url_category, aws_domain_category`) with geographic IP filtering (`geoip`) in the same rule. You must create separate rules if you want to filter traffic using both geographic IP filter and URL/domain category filter.
+ Using URL/Domain category filtering might increase traffic latency due to the additional category lookups performed for each connection matching the rule protocol and IP specifications.
