# IPS rule group capacity
<a name="rule-group-capacity-ips"></a>

Estimate an IPS rule group's capacity as the number of rules that you expect to have in it during its lifetime. You can't change this setting after you create the rule group.

The maximum capacity setting for an IPS rule group is 30,000. An IPS engine section can hold up to 50,000 rules in total across its rule groups, but a single IPS rule group is still limited to 30,000.
