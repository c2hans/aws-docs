# AWS Network Firewall metrics in Amazon CloudWatch
<a name="monitoring-cloudwatch"></a>

You can monitor AWS Network Firewall using CloudWatch, which collects raw data and processes it into readable, near real-time metrics. CloudWatch stores your metrics for 15 months, so that you can access historical information for added perspective on how your web application or service is performing. You can also set alarms that watch for certain thresholds, and send notifications or take actions when those thresholds are met. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/).

**Note**
Access to metrics in CloudWatch depends on whether you are a firewall owner or VPC endpoint association owner. A firewall owner can view metrics for firewalls they own, including VPC endpoint associations associated with the firewall. If a VPC endpoint association owner also owns the primary firewall endpoint, they can view metrics in CloudWatch for both the firewall's primary endpoints and any associated secondary endpoints (VPC endpoint associations). However, if a VPC endpoint association owner does not also own the firewall endpoint, they cannot access or view metrics in CloudWatch. For information, see [Considerations for working with firewalls and firewall endpoints](firewall-and-firewall-endpoints-considerations.md).

Use the following procedures to view the metrics for Network Firewall.

**To view metrics using the CloudWatch console**

Metrics are grouped first by the service namespace, and then by the various dimension combinations within each namespace. The CloudWatch namespace for Network Firewall is AWS/NetworkFirewall.

1. Open the CloudWatch console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Metrics**.

1. On the **All metrics** tab, select the Region and then select `AWS/NetworkFirewall`.

**To view metrics using the AWS CLI**
+ For Network Firewall, at a command prompt use the following command:

  ```
  1. aws cloudwatch list-metrics --namespace "AWS/NetworkFirewall"
  ```

## AWS Network Firewall metrics
<a name="metrics"></a>

The AWS/NetworkFirewall namespace includes the following metrics. The metrics that a firewall reports depend on whether it uses a Next Generation policy or a Classic Network Firewall policy. For information about the policy types, see [AWS Network Firewall firewall policy versions](firewall-policy-versions.md).
<a name="metrics-policy-v2"></a>
**Next Generation policy metrics**
A firewall that uses a Next Generation policy reports the following metrics. Each metric carries an `Engine` dimension that identifies the inspection engine it's for: `Firewall` for the firewall engine, `IPS` for the IPS engine, `System` for counts that aren't specific to one engine, and `TLS` for TLS inspection. The packet-verdict metrics are reported separately for each engine, so you can see each engine's effect on your traffic. For the `Engine` dimension, see [AWS Network Firewall dimensions](#metricdimensions). For information about Next Generation policies, see [Next Generation policies](firewall-policies-v2.md).

In the preceding table, `TLSReceivedPackets` is published with `Engine=System`. The TLS inspection error, timeout, and certificate revocation metrics (such as `TLSErrors`, `TLSTimedOutConnections`, and the certificate revocation status metrics) are published with `Engine=TLS`. Those error, timeout, and revocation metrics behave the same as for a Classic Network Firewall policy, and appear in the rows of the preceding table.

**Classic Network Firewall metrics**
A firewall that uses a Classic Network Firewall policy reports the following metrics.

| Metric | Description | Applicable resource |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `DroppedPackets` | Number of packets dropped due to rule actions.<br />Reporting criteria: There is a nonzero value.<br />Valid statistics: Sum | Firewalls and VPC endpoint associations |
| `DnsResolvedFlows` | Number of flows for which resolved IP validation confirmed that the destination IP address was one that the Amazon Route 53 Resolver resolved for a domain. Counted once for each flow, at the first validation verdict, not for each packet.<br />Reporting criteria: There is a nonzero value.<br />Valid statistics: Sum | Firewalls |
| `DnsUnresolvedFlows` | Number of flows for which resolved IP validation ran but the destination IP address was not one that the Amazon Route 53 Resolver resolved for a domain. This count reflects the resolution outcome and is independent of the configured action. For example, it increments even when the action is `ALERT` and no traffic is blocked.<br />Reporting criteria: There is a nonzero value.<br />Valid statistics: Sum | Firewalls |

## AWS Network Firewall dimensions
<a name="metricdimensions"></a>

Network Firewall can use the following dimension combinations to categorize your metrics:

| Dimension | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `AvailabilityZone` | Availability Zone in the Region where the Network Firewall firewall is active.  |
| `CustomAction` | Dimension for a publish metrics custom action that you defined. You can define this for a rule action in a stateless rule group or for a stateless default action in a firewall policy.  |
| `Engine` | Rules engine that processed the packet. For a firewall that uses a Classic Network Firewall policy, the value is either Stateful or Stateless. For a firewall that uses a Next Generation policy, the value identifies which inspection engine the metric is for: Firewall for the firewall engine, IPS for the IPS engine, System for counts that aren't specific to one engine, and TLS for TLS inspection. For information about Next Generation policies, see [Next Generation policies](firewall-policies-v2.md).  |
| `FirewallName` | Name that you specified for the Network Firewall firewall.  |
| `EndpointName` | Name that is generated for the Network Firewall `VpcEndpointAssociation`.  |
