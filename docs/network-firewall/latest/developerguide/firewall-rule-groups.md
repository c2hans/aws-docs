# Working with firewall rule groups in AWS Network Firewall
<a name="firewall-rule-groups"></a>

A *firewall rule group* holds the access-control rules that the firewall engine evaluates. Firewall rules are drop by default and are evaluated at connection-state hooks as a connection progresses. You use them to define which traffic is allowed into your network. The firewall engine is built on Suricata's firewall mode. For more information, see the [Suricata firewall mode documentation](https://docs.suricata.io/en/suricata-8.0.3/firewall/firewall-design.html).

**Note**
Firewall rule groups don't support IP set references—references to IP addresses or CIDR blocks held in another resource, such as an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud managed prefix list, a resource group, an address list, or a container association. To use CIDR ranges in firewall rules, use rule variables instead. IP set references are available for IPS rule groups and for Classic Network Firewall stateful rule groups; for the Classic version, see [IP set references in Suricata compatible AWS Network Firewall rule groups](rule-groups-ip-set-references.md).
