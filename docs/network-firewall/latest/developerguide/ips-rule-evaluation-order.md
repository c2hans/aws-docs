# Managing evaluation order for IPS rules
<a name="ips-rule-evaluation-order"></a>

The IPS engine evaluates rules by action order. The order in which the IPS engine evaluates rules is determined by the following settings, listed in order of precedence:

1. The Suricata `action` specification. This takes highest precedence.

   Actions are processed in the following order:

   1. `pass`

   1. `drop`

   1. `reject`

   1. `alert`
**Note**
If a packet within a flow matches a rule containing `pass` action, then Suricata doesn't scan the other packets in that flow and it passes the unscanned packets.

   For more information about the action specification, see [Suricata.yaml: Action-order](https://docs.suricata.io/en/suricata-8.0.3/configuration/suricata-yaml.html?highlight=action+order#action-order) in the [Suricata User Guide](https://docs.suricata.io/en/suricata-8.0.3/index.html).

1. The Suricata `priority` keyword. Within a specific action group, you can use the priority setting to indicate the processing order. By default, Suricata processes from the lowest numbered priority setting on up. The `priority` keyword has a mandatory numeric value ranging from 1 to 65535.

   For more information about priority, see [Meta Keywords: priority](https://docs.suricata.io/en/suricata-8.0.3/rules/meta.html?highlight=priority#priority) in the [Suricata User Guide](https://docs.suricata.io/en/suricata-8.0.3/index.html).

For example, the IPS engine evaluates all `pass` rules before evaluating any `drop`, `reject`, or `alert` rules, regardless of the value of priority settings. Within all `pass` rules, if priority keywords are present, Suricata orders the processing according to them.

The protocol layer does not impact the rule evaluation order. If you want to avoid matching against lower-level protocol packets before higher-level application protocols can be identified, consider using the `flow` keyword in your rules. This is needed because, for example, a TCP rule might match on the first packet of a TCP handshake before the engine can identify the application protocol. For information about the `flow` keyword, see [Flow Keywords](https://docs.suricata.io/en/suricata-8.0.3/rules/flow-keywords.html).
