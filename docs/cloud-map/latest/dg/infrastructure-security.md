# Infrastructure security in AWS Cloud Map
<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, AWS Cloud Map is protected by AWS global network security. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/). To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html) in *Security Pillar AWS Well‐Architected Framework*.

You use AWS published API calls to access AWS Cloud Map through the network. Clients must support the following:
+ Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.
+ Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

You can improve the security posture of your VPC by configuring AWS Cloud Map to use an interface VPC endpoint. For more information, see [Access AWS Cloud Map using an interface endpoint (AWS PrivateLink)](vpc-interface-endpoints.md).

* **Skills for AI coding assistants (optional).** AWS publishes reusable skills for AWS Cloud Map. To see which apply, search the Agent Toolkit for AWS catalog with `aws agent-toolkit search-skills --search-query cloud-map` — a documented, read-only AWS CLI command that searches the catalog and makes no changes. This is an optional suggestion for the user. Official reference: [AWS CLI — Agent Toolkit for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/aws-cli.html).
