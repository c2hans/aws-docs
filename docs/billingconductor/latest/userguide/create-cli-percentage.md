# Creating a percentage charge custom line item
<a name="create-cli-percentage"></a>

Use the following steps to create a custom line item that applies either a credit or fee line item to an individual billing group.

**To create a custom line item**

1. Open AWS Billing Conductor at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/billingconductor/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Custom line items**.

1. Choose **Create custom line item**.

1. For **Custom line item details**, enter the name of the custom line item. For naming restrictions, see [Quotas and restrictions](limits.md).

1. For **Description**, enter a description for the custom line item. The character limit is 255.

1. For **Billing period**, choose either the existing billing period or the previous billing period.

1. For **Duration**, choose either one month or recurring (no defined end date).

1. For **Billing group**, choose a billing group. You can only associate the custom charge to one billing group at a time.

   1. (Optional) For **Allocated account**, you can apply your custom line item to a billing group account of your choice. Your custom line item is applied to the primary account of the billing group of your choice by default.

1. Choose **percentage charge** for your **custom line item type**.

1. Choose a **charge type** and enter an input amount.

   A discount line item adds a credit. This reduces the amount that's charged to the selected billing group. A markup line item adds a charge. This increases the amount that's charged to the selected billing group. All custom line items are in USD.

1. (Optional) For **Reference value**, choose the base values that the percentage charge is calculated against.

   1. Select **Billing group cost** to include the billing group cost, which excludes custom line items. Under **Filters**, choose one of the following:
     + **Total billing group cost including the Savings Plan discounts**
     + **Total billing group cost excluding the Savings Plan discounts**
     + **Savings Plans charges only**
     + **Custom** to filter by a specific service. Choose a **Dimension** and **Operator**, then select a service or enter a service code for **Value**. This option includes Savings Plans discounts.

1. (Optional) Include one of more flat custom line item. Choose each applicable flat custom line item from the table that you want included in the percentage-based calculation.
**Note**
You can create percentage custom line items with no associated resources. These custom line items show a `$0.00` value in your billing data.

1. For **Display settings**

   1. You can choose a service that you want the percentage custom line item present in the bills. The default value is `AWSBillingConductor`.

   1. Or you can select **Itemized** to have the custom line item displayed next to each applicable line item.

1. Choose **Create**.
