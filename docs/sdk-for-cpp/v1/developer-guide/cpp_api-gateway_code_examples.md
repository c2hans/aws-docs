# API Gateway examples using SDK for C\+\+
<a name="cpp_api-gateway_code_examples"></a>

The following code examples show you how to perform actions and implement common scenarios by using the AWS SDK for C\+\+ with API Gateway.

*Scenarios* are code examples that show you how to accomplish specific tasks by calling multiple functions within a service or combined with other AWS services.

Each example includes a link to the complete source code, where you can find instructions on how to set up and run the code in context.
