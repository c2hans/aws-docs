# Linear Digital Convergence resilience
<a name="advrel10"></a>

 Linear and digital advertising pipelines have historically operated as independent systems with their own failure domains. Converging these into unified ad sales, fulfillment, and measurement introduces new reliability challenges: correlated failures across previously independent systems, data consistency issues between batch linear logs and streaming digital events pipelines, and measurement accuracy degradation when one source becomes unavailable.

|  ADVREL10: How do you achieve reliable convergence of linear TV ad operations and programmatic workflows when either pipeline fails?  |

## Capability intent
<a name="advrel10-capability-intent"></a>
+  Linear log ingestion and digital event streaming operate as fully independent pipelines that converge reliably into a unified data lake. A failure in either pipeline doesn't block or corrupt the other.
+  Cross-channel measurement pipelines maintain at-least-once processing with automated reconciliation that detects discrepancies within 24 hours.
+  The unified ad sales system continues operating for both channels independently during orchestration failures, using locally cached parameters with automatic reconciliation on recovery.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advrel10-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Shared database writers between linear and digital pipelines. A malformed linear log file deadlocks digital event processing.
+  No replay capability: processing failure results in permanently lost measurement data.
+  Budget reservation pattern not implemented: simultaneous system outage causes frequency cap violations or over-delivery.
