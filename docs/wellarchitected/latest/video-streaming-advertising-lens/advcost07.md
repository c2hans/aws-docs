# Converged ad sales system cost reduction
<a name="advcost07"></a>

 Publishers maintaining parallel sales planning stacks for linear TV (upfront and scatter, with age-gender guarantees) and digital (audience-based and impression-level) incur duplicated infrastructure costs for inventory management, order management, pricing engines, and forecasting models. Converging these into a unified system reduces redundant compute, storage, and operational overhead while enabling cross-channel yield optimization that increases revenue per infrastructure dollar.

|  ADVCOST07: How do you reduce the cost of maintaining parallel sales planning systems across linear and digital properties?  |

## Capability intent
<a name="advcost07-capability-intent"></a>
+  All advertising inventory data (linear TV avails, digital impressions, CTV streams, and FAST channels) resides in a single data lakehouse, removing the need for separate ETL pipelines.
+  A single ML forecasting pipeline predicts available inventory across linear, digital, and CTV properties using serverless endpoints.
+  A unified order management system handles both guaranteed linear buys and digital programmatic buying, reducing duplicate OMS licensing and hosting.
+  Inventory is dynamically allocated across linear, digital, and CTV to maximize total yield.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advcost07-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Running separate forecasting infrastructure for linear and digital that can't capture cross-channel audience migration patterns.
+  Maintaining separate OMS systems with point-to-point integrations that create brittle dependencies rather than a unified data layer.
