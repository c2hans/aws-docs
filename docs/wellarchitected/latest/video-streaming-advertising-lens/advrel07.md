# Privacy-enhanced collaboration reliability
<a name="advrel07"></a>

 Privacy-enhanced collaboration systems (allowing multiple parties to work together on advertising campaigns and data analysis while protecting individual user privacy) require high reliability to maintain secure and consistent data sharing between parties while verifying data integrity and availability. Implementing reliable practices involves designing resilient architectures, maintaining data consistency, and verifying dependable recovery mechanisms while preserving privacy.

## Capability intent
<a name="advrel07-capability-intent"></a>
+  Privacy-enhanced collaboration environments maintain privacy controls throughout failure scenarios. Failover never compromises privacy guardrails.
+  Data consistency is maintained across collaboration workflows using versioning, idempotent processing, and cross-region replication.
+  Recovery mechanisms preserve privacy encryption and access controls through the restoration process.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advrel07-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Failover configurations that bypass privacy controls to restore service faster. Availability should never override privacy requirements.
+  Differential privacy budget exhaustion that halts collaboration before the period ends, disrupting measurement workflows.
