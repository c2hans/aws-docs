# Cost-effective resources
<a name="advcost02"></a>

 Cost optimization means providing the performance a workload requires at the lowest possible price point, not just reducing spend. For advertising workloads, this means using ARM processors for faster and more cost-effective bidder nodes, compression to reduce network traffic and storage costs, provisioned capacity for predictable workloads, and Spot Instances for fault-tolerant bidding-as-a-service workloads.

## Capability intent
<a name="advcost02-capability-intent"></a>
+  AWS Graviton-based instances are used for eligible RTB workloads, delivering up to 40% better price-performance over comparable x86 instances.
+  Compression is applied across API responses, log storage, message queues, and data lake ingestion to measurably reduce data transfer and storage costs.
+  Provisioned capacity is used for predictable workloads and on-demand or serverless for variable workloads, not a one-size-fits-all approach.
+  Spot Instances are used for interruptible RTB workloads (batch analytics, model training) with proper fault-tolerance mechanisms.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advcost02-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Defaulting to x86 On-Demand instances for all RTB workloads without evaluating Graviton alternatives.
+  Storing all advertising data in uncompressed formats, inflating both storage costs and data transfer costs between services.
+  Using On-Demand capacity for all workloads regardless of traffic pattern, both over-spending on predictable workloads (should use provisioned) and under-spending on unpredictable workloads (should use serverless).
