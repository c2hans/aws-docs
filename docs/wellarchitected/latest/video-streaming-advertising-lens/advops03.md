# Change and launch readiness
<a name="advops03"></a>

 Publisher changes can alter auction competition, manifest behavior, channel schedules, and partner demand without causing an immediate service outage. Teams need release controls that reflect how each change propagates, formal evidence that a workload is ready for production, and ongoing management of external integrations. This capability defines how teams prepare, validate, release, and reassess those changes.

## Capability intent
<a name="advops03-capability-intent"></a>
+  Teams select staged deployment and rollback methods according to how each advertising change propagates and how quickly failure becomes visible.
+  Every publisher launch passes an operational readiness review with a named owner, verified monitoring, tested recovery, and peak-load evidence.
+  Advertising configurations are version controlled and pass automated syntax, schema, and integration checks before deployment.
+  Third-party demand-side platform integrations are validated at onboarding and monitored throughout their operating life.
+  Release and integration controls evolve from production defects, rollback exercises, and partner-performance evidence.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advops03-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Deploying adapter, manifest, schedule, or rendering changes to all traffic without matching the rollout method to propagation and recovery behavior.
+  Launching workloads without verified dashboards, trained on-call ownership, tested rollback, or peak-load evidence.
+  Treating operational readiness reviews as documentation exercises that can't stop activation.
+  Editing advertising configurations outside version control or relying on syntax checks without integration tests.
+  Treating demand partner onboarding as a one-time setup and omitting per-partner identity, latency, and yield baselines.
+  Using one noisy metric as an automated rollback trigger, which causes false rollbacks and encourages teams to disable the control.
