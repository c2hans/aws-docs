# Data management design
<a name="advperf04"></a>

 Advertising workloads have different data classification, availability, and access latency needs based on their subsystems. Implement a strategy to identify an appropriate AWS data store service option, along with scaling and monitoring considerations. The optimal data management solution for a particular system varies based on data type, access patterns, required throughput, frequency of access, frequency of update, and availability and durability constraints.

## Capability intent
<a name="advperf04-capability-intent"></a>
+  Every datastore in your advertising stack is selected based on a clear understanding of the latency tier, availability requirements, and access patterns of the data it holds.
+  Real-time bid data, audience segmentation data, and historical reporting data each land in a service optimized for their specific characteristics.
+  Your distributed database setup (sharding and replication) is designed for your performance, cost, and availability needs, not applied uniformly regardless of data category.
+  You have detailed performance and observability monitoring configured to tune queries and refine compute and storage allocation.
+  User profile data is managed with retention policies and geographic placement that bound storage costs while maintaining bid path performance.
+  [AWS Clean Rooms](https://aws.amazon.com/clean-rooms/) query performance is optimized through data partitioning, aggregation, and filtering before query execution.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advperf04-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Using a single database technology across all advertising data categories regardless of their latency profile, forcing low-latency real-time bidding data and high-latency historical reporting data to compete for the same storage resources.
+  Storing all historical user profile data indefinitely in DynamoDB, paying provisioned or on-demand pricing for data that is rarely queried during bid evaluation.
+  Replicating user profile data across multiple regions in real time, incurring high cross-region transfer costs for data that is almost never accessed from more than one Region simultaneously.
+  Deploying bidder nodes and database nodes in different Availability Zones without Availability Zone-aware routing, paying cross-AZ data transfer charges on every database query from the bid path.
+  Running Clean Rooms queries against large unpartitioned datasets without aggregations or filters, hitting the 5 GB result size limit and generating long query processing times.
