# Latency-sensitive advertising
<a name="advrel02"></a>

 Consider strategies for managing latency-sensitive advertising workloads through throttling and rate-limiting implementations. Avoid traditional retry mechanisms for fast-failing services, implement effective caching strategies, and proportionally scale across all system components to maintain consistent performance. In real-time bidding, the workload must handle failures in latency-sensitive services within the 100 ms bid response window. There is no room for exponential backoff or deep retry queues.

## Capability intent
<a name="advrel02-capability-intent"></a>
+  Failures in latency-sensitive services are handled with fast-fail approaches and appropriate rate-limiting rather than traditional exponential backoff and retry.
+  Caching strategies are applied at multiple levels (client-side, server-side, CDN) to reduce response latency and the load on database clusters.
+  All system components (application servers, load balancers, databases) scale proportionally to avoid scale mismatch bottlenecks at the boundaries between components.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advrel02-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Using exponential backoff on bid path services, where a 5-second retry delay results in many failed bids and potentially insurmountable retry queues.
+  Applying the same rate limit to all clients regardless of their traffic volume agreements, under-serving high-value partners while over-allocating capacity to low-value connections.
+  Not considering the latency impact of cache misses during peak traffic. If a cache cold-starts during a spike, all requests hit the database simultaneously.
