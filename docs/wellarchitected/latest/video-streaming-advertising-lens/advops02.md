# Advertising workload observability
<a name="advops02"></a>

 Advertising delivery depends on distributed systems, partner connections, automated decisions, and channel-specific fulfillment paths. Operators need correlated telemetry across technical and business layers to identify whether a failure affects infrastructure, auction behavior, campaign pacing, or revenue. This capability defines the observability needed to detect, diagnose, and route those conditions.

## Capability intent
<a name="advops02-capability-intent"></a>
+  Advertising workloads have telemetry across infrastructure, applications, delivery pipelines, user experience, and monetization layers.
+  Structured metrics, logs, and traces share correlation identifiers so teams can follow failures across components and automated decisions.
+  Partner connectivity and traffic-management health are measured independently from application health and tied to bid outcomes.
+  Bot and agent traffic is classified by operational purpose and revenue effect rather than treated as one traffic category.
+  Server-side auction health is visible by adapter, demand partner, identity framework, and yield contribution.
+  Campaign pacing and fulfillment are measured against shared commitments across linear and digital channels.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advops02-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Monitoring infrastructure health without a monetization layer, allowing technical SLOs to remain healthy while revenue declines.
+  Treating SGAI health as one completion metric instead of measuring manifest generation, content delivery, and client retrieval separately.
+  Collecting metrics, logs, and traces without consistent identifiers, which leaves teams unable to correlate one failure across layers.
+  Grouping licensed AI agents, authorized crawlers, unauthorized scrapers, and fraudulent impression traffic into one bot category.
+  Monitoring aggregate auction revenue without per-adapter and per-identity-framework dimensions, which hides underperforming demand partners.
+  Maintaining separate linear and digital campaign dashboards or relying on delayed reports and static pacing thresholds, which reduces the time available for recovery.
