# ADVREL07-BP03 Implement secure and privacy-preserving recovery mechanisms for collaboration workloads
<a name="advrel07-bp03"></a>

 Implement recovery procedures that maintain data encryption throughout the process, verify privacy controls before restoring access, and establish recovery time objectives aligned with privacy requirements.

 **Desired outcome:**
+  Recovery procedures maintain data encryption throughout the restoration process.
+  Privacy controls are verified before any restored collaboration environment accepts new queries.
+  Secure state management helps interrupted privacy computations terminate safely rather than exposing partial results.

 **Common anti-patterns:**
+  Restoration procedures that decrypt data into an unprotected state during recovery.
+  Restoring a collaboration environment and accepting queries before verifying privacy controls are intact.
+  Setting RTO without accounting for mandatory privacy-verification steps, which makes the target unachievable.
+  Leaving interrupted computations' partial results accessible or failing to reconcile their privacy budget consumption.

 **Benefits of establishing this best practice:**
+  Data encryption is maintained throughout the restoration process.
+  Privacy controls are verified before a restored environment accepts any new queries.
+  Secure state management helps interrupted computations terminate safely without exposing partial results.

 **Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance
<a name="implementation-guidance"></a>

 Ad data must stay encrypted at every stage of restoration. Standard DR patterns assume a plaintext window during restore. For AWS Clean Rooms workloads, any such window is a data exposure event.

 Privacy verification tasks take real time and cannot be shortened (such as KMS key policy checks, analysis rule validation, IAM confirmation, and budget reconciliation). An RTO that ignores these steps looks achievable in planning but fails during a real event. When the honest RTO exceeds the target, use a pre-validated warm standby to meet it. Skipping verification is not an acceptable substitute.

 Aggregation hides individual records behind differential privacy noise. If a computation is interrupted, its partial output in S3 can reveal individual-record information that the finished query would have obscured. Secure cleanup is a privacy requirement. Interrupted queries also consume budget. Reconcile that consumption to prevent over-extraction across repeated attempts.

 Privacy and compliance teams define what counts as intact controls. Operations teams run the restoration. Keep a restored environment closed to queries until the gate owner accepts it. Both groups must agree on the acceptance criteria in advance.

### Implementation steps
<a name="implementation-steps"></a>

1.  **Define privacy-aware RTO/RPO for collaboration workloads:** Document recovery objectives that account for privacy validation time. Tier 1 collaboration data (active measurement campaigns): RTO 4 hours (including privacy control verification), RPO 1 hour. Analytics archives: RTO 24 hours, RPO 4 hours. Include privacy control restoration and verification time in all RTO calculations.

1.  **Implement automated privacy control verification post-restoration:** Create a Lambda function that runs after every restoration operation and verifies: KMS key policies are intact and restrictive, Clean Rooms collaboration analysis rules are correctly configured, IAM policies for collaboration participants are unmodified, and differential privacy settings are restored. Block collaboration access until all verifications pass.

1.  **Configure secure state cleanup for interrupted computations:** For Nitro Enclave computations, implement cleanup handlers that securely wipe enclave memory when computations are interrupted (regardless of cause). For Clean Rooms queries, implement a query state tracking system that can identify interrupted queries and mark their privacy budget consumption as consumed to guard against re-execution bypassing budget limits.
