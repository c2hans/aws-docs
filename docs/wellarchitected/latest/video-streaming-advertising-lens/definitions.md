<a name="definitions"></a>

 The following terms are used throughout this lens. They represent the key concepts and personas in programmatic advertising that inform the best practices in each pillar.

 Digital advertising (ads) refers to marketing through online channels, like websites and streaming content, as well as linear channels, like cable television. Digital ads span media formats, including text, image, audio, and video. They can help you achieve a variety of business goals, ranging from brand awareness to customer engagement. They can also help you launch new products and drive repeat sales. <a name="definitions-fig1"></a>

+  **Ad network:** Provides an outsourced sales capability for publishers and aggregates inventory and audiences from numerous sources in a single buying opportunity for media buyers.

+  **Ad server:** A system that manages, delivers, and tracks online ads. Used by publishers, advertisers, and ad networks.

 **Technology intermediary:**
+  **Ad exchange:** Provides a sales channel connecting publishers and ad networks with advertisers. Brings a technology system facilitating automated auction-based pricing, selling, and buying in real-time.
+  **DMP (Data Management Platform):** An aggregator of third-party data made available commercially to enrich ad supply and expand targeting attributes.
+  **CDP (Customer Data Platform):** A data solution that centralizes customer-related data to link and bridge multi-channel customer journeys through one identity profile.

## Advertising technology terms
<a name="advertising-technology-terms"></a>
+  **Beacon:** Tracking pixels or tags used to measure ad performance, attribution, and analytics.
+  **Click:** A metric counted every time someone clicks on an ad.
+  **Fill rate:** Ad impressions generated in an ad space divided by the total inventory available on that ad space.
+  **Impression:** An ad view counted every time a creative ad is served to a user. Considered one of the basic campaign performance indicators.
+  **IAB (Interactive Advertising Bureau):** An advertising business organization that develops industry standards, conducts research, and provides legal support for the online advertising industry.
+  **OpenRTB:** A standard of communication between buyers and sellers of real-time bidding advertising, allowing advertising platforms to speak the same language when conducting online media transactions.

## Publisher-specific terms
<a name="publisher-specific-terms"></a>

+  **SGAI (Server-Guided Ad Insertion):** A hybrid ad insertion approach where the server generates manifests with SCTE-35 markers (CDN-cacheable, viewer-agnostic) while the client device handles personalized ad fetching and rendering. Combines server-side intelligence with client-side execution.
+  **SSAI (Server-Side Ad Insertion):** Ad insertion approach where the server stitches ads into the video stream before delivery, creating a personalized stream per viewer session. Provides uninterrupted playback and ad-blocker resistance.
+  **CSAI (Client-Side Ad Insertion):** Ad insertion approach where the video player manages the full ad lifecycle (detection, request, rendering, and measurement) on the viewer's device.
+  **SCTE-35:** A digital program insertion cueing message standard used to signal ad break opportunities within a video stream. Includes multiple message types: spliceinsert (immediate triggers), timesignal (scheduled markers), splicenull (heartbeat signals), and privatecommand (vendor-specific extensions).
+  **EPG (Electronic Program Guide):** A listing of scheduled programming for a FAST channel, distributed to downstream systems and displayed in streaming apps.
+  **Prebid Server:** An open-source server-side header bidding solution that sends parallel bid requests to multiple demand partners simultaneously, replacing the sequential waterfall model.

## Identity and privacy terms
<a name="identity-and-privacy-terms"></a>

+  **Seller-defined audiences (SDA):** A privacy-preserving audience solution allowing publishers to create targetable segments based on first-party data, activated through real-time bidding without exposing individual user data.
