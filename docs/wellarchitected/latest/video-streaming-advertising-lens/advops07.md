# Continuous yield optimization
<a name="advops07"></a>

 The standard Well-Architected OE pillar includes an Evolve area focused on learning, sharing, and improving (OPS11). This capability maps those nine OPS11 best practices to publisher yield optimization: ongoing improvement feedback loops, game days and failure injection exercises, A/B testing frameworks for ad format experimentation, post-incident reviews for revenue-affecting events, and knowledge sharing across publisher workload teams. Organizations that design advertising workloads should adopt practices that improve yield through continual refinement, safe experimentation, and learning from failures.

## Capability intent
<a name="advops07-capability-intent"></a>
+  eCPM trends, fill rate patterns, adapter performance data, and ad break completion metrics are regularly analyzed and translated into optimization initiatives through systematic feedback loops.
+  Publisher teams practice responding to realistic failure scenarios through quarterly game days, identifying monitoring and runbook gaps proactively before real incidents occur.
+  A/B testing frameworks enable safe experimentation with new ad formats, placement strategies, and auction configurations while measuring impact on both revenue and viewer engagement.
+  Every incident causing measurable yield loss undergoes a blameless post-incident review producing concrete improvement actions with quantified revenue impact.
+  Operational insights, incident lessons, and optimization techniques are systematically shared across publisher workload teams, accelerating improvement across all themes.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advops07-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Reviewing yield data only when revenue drops are reported by finance teams rather than through proactive operational monitoring.
+  Conducting post-incident reviews only for availability incidents while ignoring revenue-affecting events that did not cause system downtime.
+  Running A/B experiments without guardrail metrics that protect viewer experience from degradation.
+  Siloed publisher workload teams (Prebid, SGAI, FAST channels, and ad formats) operating independently without sharing operational insights that apply across workload types.
+  Not tracking improvement action completion rates after post-incident reviews, missing the accountability that drives ongoing improvement.
