# Trust, safety, and privacy workload efficiency
<a name="advsus05"></a>

 Privacy collaboration, fraud detection, and content moderation are the data-intensive trust-and-safety workloads that run alongside advertising delivery. Each analyzes large volumes of impression, click, content, or partner data on an ongoing basis, so each carries a resource and carbon footprint that grows with advertising activity. The sustainability levers are shared across all three: scale compute to actual demand rather than provisioning for peak, run ongoing work on energy-efficient processors, defer and batch work that has no real-time requirement, and analyze data where it resides to avoid moving it across Regions.

## Capability intent
<a name="advsus05-capability-intent"></a>
+  Privacy collaboration, fraud detection, and content moderation run on right-sized, energy-efficient compute that scales with actual demand rather than remaining provisioned for peak.
+  Machine learning inference and other continual processing run on purpose-built, high-efficiency hardware selected for performance per watt.
+  Work without a real-time latency requirement is separated from latency-sensitive paths, then batched and scheduled to raise utilization and match periods of lower grid carbon intensity.
+  Data is analyzed where it resides and aggregated close to its source, limiting cross-Region movement of large impression, click, and media datasets.
+  Signal, audit, and result data is stored on tiers matched to its access pattern and retained only as long as compliance, security, or model accuracy requires.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advsus05-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Running privacy, fraud, or moderation workloads continuously on persistent, over-provisioned instances regardless of actual demand.
+  Processing every event or asset at full fidelity and in real time when intelligent sampling or batching would meet the same business and risk requirement.
+  Defaulting to general-purpose x86 compute without evaluating energy-efficient, purpose-built processor options for matching, detection, and inference.
+  Centralizing analysis in a single Region and moving large volumes of impression, click, or media data across Regions, or copying partner datasets rather than analyzing them where they reside.
+  Retaining raw signals, results, and audit trails indefinitely on a single high-performance storage tier with no lifecycle or deletion policy.
