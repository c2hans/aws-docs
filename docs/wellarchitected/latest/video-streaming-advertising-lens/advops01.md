# Operational governance and accountability
<a name="advops01"></a>

 Advertising workloads require clear decision rights across architecture, data, campaign operations, and revenue protection. Linear and digital teams need shared accountability for technical health and campaign outcomes, especially when one commercial commitment crosses several delivery systems. This capability defines the organizational mechanisms and common operating model for those decisions.

|  ADVOPS01: How do you govern advertising workloads and assign accountability across architecture, data, yield, and campaign operations?  |

## Capability intent
<a name="advops01-capability-intent"></a>
+  Teams document advertising architecture decisions with their rationale, risk exposure, and reversibility.
+  Responsible, accountable, consulted, and informed (RACI) assignments define ownership for each advertising process and cross-channel campaign workflow.
+  Key performance indicators (KPIs) and service-level objectives (SLOs) connect delivery quality, yield health, and campaign fulfillment to revenue outcomes.
+  Data governance and compliance operations cover advertising regulations, audience data, and agent-driven advertising workflows.
+  Publisher operations teams treat yield degradation as an operational incident with defined severity and escalation paths.
+  Linear and digital campaign teams use shared data models, workflows, and reporting to maintain one view of campaign health.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advops01-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Selecting SGAI or header-bidding architectures without documenting caching behavior, failure scope, risk exposure, and reversibility.
+  Leaving ownership unclear between engineering, ad operations, partner management, and campaign teams for manifest, adapter, and fulfillment changes.
+  Defining SLOs only for infrastructure availability, which can remain healthy while yield or campaign delivery degrades.
+  Treating yield degradation as a business-only concern instead of an operational incident with defined severity and escalation.
+  Maintaining separate linear and digital campaign records, KPI frameworks, and teams that depend on manual synchronization.
+  Introducing a shared campaign interface without reconciling channel terminology, decision rights, and corrective workflows, which drives teams back to their previous tools.
