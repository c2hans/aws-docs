# Incident response and operational process management
<a name="advops04"></a>

 Advertising operations must match response mechanisms to failure predictability, data urgency, and revenue impact while maintaining one incident process across linear and digital channels. Teams need documented and automated response paths, measurement of process effectiveness, and controlled real-time decisions that remain correct under load. This capability covers production operations after launch rather than change readiness.

## Capability intent
<a name="advops04-capability-intent"></a>
+  Shared runbooks, investigation playbooks, severity classifications, and escalation paths cover publisher failures across linear and digital operations.
+  High-frequency responses are automated with rate limits, stop conditions, validation checks, and reversal procedures that help avoid cascading failures.
+  Teams measure mean time to detect, mean time to resolve, runbook success, escalation frequency, and automation coverage alongside workload outcomes.
+  Ad operations measurement covers shoppable and non-intrusive formats that conventional click-through attribution doesn't represent.
+  Event-driven placement processes handle duplicate, delayed, out-of-order, and discarded events without corrupting campaign state.
+  Operational data procedures vary by latency, sensitivity, processing frequency, and retention requirements.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advops04-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Maintaining only generic infrastructure runbooks or failing to distinguish executable runbooks from hypothesis-driven investigation playbooks.
+  Automating responses without rate limits, stop conditions, or post-action validation, which can amplify a false signal.
+  Tracking only workload and conventional click-through metrics while ignoring response-process health and format-specific engagement evidence.
+  Keeping separate runbook repositories and incident processes for linear and digital teams, which delays response to cross-channel failures.
+  Applying one monitoring interval, processing method, or retention policy to data with different latency and sensitivity requirements.
+  Designing event pipelines that assume one delivery attempt and global ordering or that discard load without recording it, which corrupts pacing and budget state.
