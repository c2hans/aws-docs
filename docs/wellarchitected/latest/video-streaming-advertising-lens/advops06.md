# FAST channel operations
<a name="advops06"></a>

 Free Ad-Supported Streaming TV (FAST) channels turn back-catalog content into ad-supported linear channels that run around the clock, so their operational health has to be tracked continuously. This capability covers the operational demands of linear streaming infrastructure: intelligent scheduling, content licensing workflows, ad fill optimization, and playout monitoring. It spans continuous readiness, observability for scheduling, fill, and playout, and ongoing KPI tracking and operational cadences.

## Capability intent
<a name="advops06-capability-intent"></a>
+  FAST channel infrastructure is validated for continual operations before channel launch, with verified monitoring, failover procedures, and capacity planning.
+  Real-time visibility covers FAST channel scheduling accuracy, ad pod fill rates, and playout continuity with automated alerting on anomalies.
+  Dedicated FAST channel dashboards provide real-time and trend visibility into channel uptime, ad monetization, and viewer engagement, reviewed in regular operational cadences.

## Common issues to watch for
<a name="advops06-common-issues-to-watch-for"></a>
+  Launching FAST channels without validating multi-AZ or Multi-Region failover procedures, discovering gaps only during an actual Availability Zone failure.
+  No EPG completeness validation. Asset unavailability discovered only at broadcast time rather than during pre-validation.
+  No pre-flight validation means that content gaps and missing asset references are discovered at playout time rather than 60 minutes beforehand when remediation is still feasible.
+  No synthetic monitoring, relying solely on infrastructure metrics without validating that viewers can actually access the stream and receive valid ad breaks.
+  Operating FAST channels without clear ownership boundaries between content scheduling, playout engineering, and ad operations functions.
