# ADVREL08-BP02 Establish reliable data collection and validation pipelines for measurement accuracy
<a name="advrel08-bp02"></a>

 Build reliable data collection and validation pipelines with real-time monitoring, automated reconciliation, and recovery procedures to maintain measurement accuracy in advertising systems.

 **Desired outcome:**
+  Measurement events are collected with at-least-once delivery guarantees and deduplicated before processing.
+  Data quality checks run at each pipeline stage to catch anomalies before they propagate to reporting.
+  Failed measurement events are processed from dead-letter queues rather than discarded.

 **Common anti-patterns:**
+  Collecting measurement events without at-least-once delivery guarantees, so events are lost on failure.
+  Discarding failed events instead of routing them to a dead-letter queue for reprocessing.
+  Running data quality checks only at the end, so anomalies propagate to reporting before detection.
+  No reconciliation against third-party provider totals, so collection drift accumulates undetected.

 **Benefits of establishing this best practice:**
+  At-least-once collection with deduplication supports measurement completeness without double counting.
+  Stage-by-stage data quality checks catch anomalies before they reach reporting.
+  Dead-letter queue processing recovers failed events rather than losing them.

 **Level of risk exposed if this best practice is not established:** High

## Implementation guidance

 The longer an error remains, the higher its corresponding cost for correction. Once an event enters the Kinesis pipeline, it spreads to aggregation, reporting, and billing. Fixing it there requires a full AWS Glue ETL reprocessing run and possible advertiser billing adjustments. Validate close to collection to help avoid such steadily rising costs.

 At-least-once delivery accepts duplicates in exchange for never losing an event. Pair it with DynamoDB-backed deduplication to remove the duplicates the guarantee allows. Together, they give completeness without double counting.

 Accept events to S3 and route validation failures to an SQS dead-letter queue. Store the original events in an S3 bucket to preserve valid data when a client is misconfigured, and use a dead-letter queue to block invalid events from moving downstream undetected.

 A KCL consumer can fail without raising an alarm, and small persistent losses cause measurement drift over time. Reconciliation against third-party totals eventually exposes the drift, but by then some data might be unrecoverable. Assign an owner to the reconciliation cadence who acts on its findings. Add stage-by-stage data quality checks so that owner detects anomalies earlier than a final check would.

### Implementation steps
<a name="implementation-steps"></a>

1.  **Deploy Kinesis Data Streams for measurement event collection:** Create Kinesis shards sized for your peak measurement event throughput (each shard handles 1,000 records/second). Configure Kinesis Consumer Library (KCL) with automatic checkpoint management. Set ShardIteratorType to TRIM\_HORIZON during recovery scenarios so that no events are missed.

1.  **Implement dead-letter queue processing for all measurement consumers:** Configure DLQ on all SQS queues and Kinesis stream consumers. Set DLQ depth alarms at 100 messages (immediate investigation required). Deploy Lambda functions that process DLQ messages on a 15-minute schedule, attempting reprocessing with exponential backoff. Generate reports on DLQ processing for data loss tracking.

1.  **Run automated reconciliation between measurement sources:** Deploy a daily AWS Glue job that compares measurement totals from your collection pipeline against third-party verification provider reports. Flag discrepancies exceeding 2% for investigation. Store reconciliation results in S3 and publish summary metrics to CloudWatch for trend analysis.
