This guide documents the classic version of the AWS Wickr administration console, released before March 13, 2025. For documentation on the new AWS Wickr administration console, see [ Administration Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wickr/latest/adminguide/what-is-wickr.html).

# Resource-based policies within Wickr
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-resource-based-policies"></a>

**Supports resource-based policies:** No

Resource-based policies are JSON policy documents that you attach to a resource. Examples of resource-based policies are IAM *role trust policies* and Amazon S3 *bucket policies*. In services that support resource-based policies, service administrators can use them to control access to a specific resource. For the resource where the policy is attached, the policy defines what actions a specified principal can perform on that resource and under what conditions. You must [specify a principal](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_principal.html) in a resource-based policy. Principals can include accounts, users, roles, federated users, or AWS services.

To enable cross-account access, you can specify an entire account or IAM entities in another account as the principal in a resource-based policy. For more information, see [Cross account resource access in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/access_policies-cross-account-resource-access.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.
