# Known issues for the CloudHSM CLI for AWS CloudHSM
<a name="ki-cli-sdk"></a>

The following issues impact the CloudHSM CLI for AWS CloudHSM.

**Topics**
+ [The `key-reference` filter fails to select session keys](#ki-cli-1)

## The `key-reference` filter fails to select session keys
<a name="ki-cli-1"></a>

Commands that use `key-reference` to filter session (ephemeral) keys fail with the error `UX000: Ephemeral key is not expected because we cannot build it without HSM Connection`.

The [key set-attribute](cloudhsm_cli-key-set-attribute.md) command is not affected and can select session keys by `key-reference`.
+ **Workaround: **Use attribute-based filters (such as `attr.label`) to select session keys. If multiple session keys share identical attributes, use [key set-attribute](cloudhsm_cli-key-set-attribute.md) with the `key-reference` filter to assign unique labels first, then filter by label.
+ **Resolution status: **We are working on a fix to enable `key-reference` filters for session keys across all applicable CloudHSM CLI commands.
