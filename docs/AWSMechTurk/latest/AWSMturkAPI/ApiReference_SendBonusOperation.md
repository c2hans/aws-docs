# SendBonus
<a name="ApiReference_SendBonusOperation"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_SendBonusOperation-description"></a>

The `SendBonus` operation issues a payment of money from your account to a Worker. This payment happens separately from the reward you pay to the Worker when you approve the Worker's assignment. The SendBonus operation requires the Worker's ID and the assignment ID as parameters to initiate payment of the bonus. You must include a message that explains the reason for the bonus payment, as the Worker may not be expecting the payment. Amazon Mechanical Turk collects a fee for bonus payments, similar to the HIT listing fee.

 This operation fails if your account does not have enough funds to pay for both the bonus and the fees. This operation may also fail if the Worker in question has not completed an Assignment for you in the last six months.
