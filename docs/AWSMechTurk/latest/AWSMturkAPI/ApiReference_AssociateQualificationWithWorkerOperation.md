# AssociateQualificationWithWorker
<a name="ApiReference_AssociateQualificationWithWorkerOperation"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_AssociateQualificationWithWorkerOperation-description"></a>

 The `AssociateQualificationWithWorker` operation gives a Worker a Qualification. `AssociateQualificationWithWorker` does not require that the Worker submit a Qualification request. It immediately gives the Worker the Qualification.

 You can only assign a Qualification of a Qualification type that you created (using the [CreateQualificationType](ApiReference_CreateQualificationTypeOperation.md) operation).

**Tip**
`AssociateQualificationWithWorker` does not affect any pending Qualification requests for the Qualification by the Worker. If you associate a Qualification to a Worker, then later accept a Qualification request made by the Worker, accepting the request may modify the Qualification score. To resolve a pending Qualification request without affecting the Qualification the Worker already has, reject the request with the [RejectQualificationRequest](ApiReference_RejectQualificationRequestOperation.md) operation.
