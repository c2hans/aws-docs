<a name="ApiReference_HITDataStructureArticle"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_HITDataStructureArticle-description"></a>

 The HIT data structure represents a single HIT, including all the information necessary for a Worker to accept and complete the HIT.

The HIT data structure is used as a response element for the following operations:
+ `CreateHIT`
+ `GetHIT`
+ `ListReviewableHITs`
+ `ListHITs`
