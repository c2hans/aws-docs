# Assignment
<a name="ApiReference_AssignmentDataStructureArticle"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_AssignmentDataStructureArticle-description"></a>

 The Assignment data structure represents a single assignment of a HIT to a Worker. The assignment tracks the Worker's efforts to complete the HIT, and contains the results for later retrieval.

 The Assignment data structure is used as a response element for the following operations:
+ `GetAssignment`
+ `ListAssignmentsForHIT`
