# ListReviewableHITs
<a name="ApiReference_ListReviewableHITsOperation"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_ListReviewableHITsOperation-description"></a>

 The `ListReviewableHITs` operation retrieves the HITs with `Status` equal to **Reviewable** or `Status` equal to **Reviewing** that belong to the Requester calling the operation. Once a HIT has either expired or had the requested number of assignments submitted, it enters the **Reviewable** state. The only ways a HIT can leave the **Reviewable** states are:
+ By being extended, so assignments are once again available on the marketplace.
+ Because `UpdateHITReviewStatus` has updated the status to **Reviewing**.
+ By being disposed, either manually via the `DisposeHIT` operation, or automatically after 120 days.

 You can limit the query to HITs with a specified HIT type.

 The operation sorts the results, divides them into numbered pages, and returns a single page of results. You can control sorting and pagination can be controlled with parameters to the operation.

 When (`PageNumber` x `PageSize`) is less than 100, you can get reliable results when you use any of the sort properties. If this number is greater than 100, use the **Enumeration** sort property for best results. The **Enumeration** sort property guarantees that the operation returns all reviewable HITs with no duplicates, but not in any specific order.
