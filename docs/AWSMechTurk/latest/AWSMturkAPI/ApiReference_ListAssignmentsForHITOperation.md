# ListAssignmentsForHIT
<a name="ApiReference_ListAssignmentsForHITOperation"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_ListAssignmentsForHITOperation-description"></a>

The `ListAssignmentsForHIT` operation retrieves completed assignments for a HIT. You can use this operation to retrieve the results for a HIT.

 You can get assignments for a HIT at any time, even if the HIT is not yet Reviewable. If a HIT requested multiple assignments, and has received some results but has not yet become Reviewable, you can still retrieve the partial results with this operation.

 Use the AssignmentStatuses parameter to control which set of assignments for a HIT are returned. The GetAssignmentsForHIT operation can return submitted assignments awaiting approval, or it can return assignments that have already been approved or rejected. You can set AssignmentStatuses=Approved,Rejected to get assignments that have already been approved and rejected together in one result set.

 Only the Requester who created the HIT can retrieve the assignments for that HIT.

 Results are sorted and divided into numbered pages and the operation returns a single page of results. You can use the parameters of the operation to control sorting and pagination.
