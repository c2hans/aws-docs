# ApproveAssignment
<a name="ApiReference_ApproveAssignmentOperation"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_ApproveAssignmentOperation-description"></a>

The `ApproveAssignment` operation approves the results of a completed assignment created with the API.

Approving an assignment initiates two payments from the Requester's Amazon.com account: the Worker who submitted the results is paid the reward specified in the HIT, and Amazon Mechanical Turk fees are debited. If the Requester's account does not have adequate funds for these payments, the call to ApproveAssignment returns an exception, and the approval is not processed. You can include an optional feedback message with the approval, which the Worker can see in the Status section of the web site.

You can also call this operation on assignments that were previous rejected and approve them by over-riding the previous rejection. This works only on rejected assignments that were submitted within the previous 30 days and only if the assignment's related HIT has not been deleted.

**Note**
To maintain the consistency of the assignments for HITs in a batch, if a HIT is created through the [Amazon Mechanical Turk Requester website](https://requester.mturk.com/create/projects/new), you must use the Requester website UI to approve or reject the work.
If you want to be able to approve or reject work through the API, you can use a [HITLayout](ApiReference_HITLayoutArticle.md) when calling [CreateHIT](ApiReference_CreateHITOperation.md) to utilize an existing template from the [Amazon Mechanical Turk Requester website](https://requester.mturk.com/create/projects/new)
