# CreateHITType
<a name="ApiReference_CreateHITTypeOperation"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_CreateHITTypeOperation-description"></a>

 The `CreateHITType` operation creates a new HIT type.

`CreateHITType` lets you be explicit about which HITs ought to be the same type. It also gives you error checking, to ensure that you call the [CreateHITWithHITType](ApiReference_CreateHITWithHITTypeOperation.md) operation with a valid HIT type ID.

If you register a HIT type with values that match an existing HIT type, the HIT type ID of the existing type will be returned.
