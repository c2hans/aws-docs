# RejectAssignment
<a name="ApiReference_RejectAssignmentOperation"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_RejectAssignmentOperation-description"></a>

The `RejectAssignment` operation rejects the results of a completed assignment.

You must include a feedback message with the rejection, which the Worker can see in the Status section of the web site. When you include a feedback message with the rejection, it helps the Worker understand why the assignment was rejected, and can improve the quality of the results the Worker submits in the future.

Only the Requester who created the HIT can reject an assignment for the HIT.

**Note**
To maintain the consistency of the assignments for HITs in a batch, if a HIT is created through the [Amazon Mechanical Turk Requester website](https://requester.mturk.com/create/projects/new), you must use the Requester website UI to approve or reject the work.
If you want to be able to approve or reject work through the API, you can use a [HITLayout](ApiReference_HITLayoutArticle.md) when calling [CreateHIT](ApiReference_CreateHITOperation.md) to utilize an existing template from the [Amazon Mechanical Turk Requester website](https://requester.mturk.com/create/projects/new)
