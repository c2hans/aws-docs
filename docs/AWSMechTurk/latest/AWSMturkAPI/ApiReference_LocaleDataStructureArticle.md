# Locale
<a name="ApiReference_LocaleDataStructureArticle"></a>

## Description
<a name="ApiReference_LocaleDataStructureArticle-description"></a>

 The Locale data structure represents a geographical region or location.

 The Locale data structure is used as part of the [ QualificationRequirement](ApiReference_QualificationRequirementDataStructureArticle.md) data structure when you specify a requirement based on the locale Qualification, and as part of the [Qualification](ApiReference_QualificationDataStructureArticle.md) data structure that describes the value of a locale Qualification.

 When used in a QualificationRequirement, the Locale data structure only needs to contain as much of the locale as the Worker needs to match to meet the requirement. For example, a requirement that the Worker be living anywhere in the United States would have only the `Country` field.

**Note**
 Currently, a Locale data structure only supports the `Country` field and `Subdivision` field. Please note that subdivisions or states are only available for the United States of America.

## Elements
