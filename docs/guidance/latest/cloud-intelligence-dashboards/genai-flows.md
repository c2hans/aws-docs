# Flows
<a name="genai-flows"></a>

Create intelligent workflows that monitor your CID dashboards and automatically take actions based on dashboard insights. Amazon Quick offers multiple approaches for creating flows, allowing you to choose the method that best fits your workflow preferences and technical requirements.

Flows can use the same Spaces as the CID agents. Ready-made CID flows are coming; until then, start from the examples below.

## Flow Creation Methods
<a name="flow-creation-methods"></a>

You can create CID flows using different approaches. This guide demonstrates two methods:

 **Method 1: Natural Language Prompt (NLP)** - Describe your desired flow in plain language and let Quick generate it automatically using AI-powered flow creation.

 **Method 2: Build from Scratch** - Create a blank flow and configure each step manually for complete control over workflow design and logic.

## Flow Example 1: Automated Cost Anomaly Investigation & Action
<a name="flow-example-1-automated-cost-anomaly-investigation-action"></a>

This flow automatically detects cost spikes in your CUDOS dashboard and instantly investigates root causes using AI-powered analysis. When anomalies exceed your threshold, it generates immediate action plans and alerts teams with specific remediation steps.

 **Navigate to Quick Flows**
+ In Quick console, select "Flows"
+ Click "Create Flow"
+ Click "Generate"

 **Enter Flow Description**

```
Create a flow named "Cost Anomaly Investigation & Action" that automatically detects AWS cost spikes and investigates root causes.

Setup:
* Add text input "Alert Threshold" (default: "20% increase")
* Add text input "Analysis Time Period" (default: "Last 30 days")
* Add dashboard step "Extract CUDOS Cost Data" using your CUDOS dashboard to analyze cost trends above @Alert Threshold for @Analysis Time Period
* Add reasoning group "Anomaly Detection" (runs once) that triggers investigation only if anomaly detected

Inside reasoning group, add these steps in order:
1. Web search step titled "Research Causes" to research AWS cost spike causes for the identified services
2. Analysis step titled "Root Cause Analysis" using Versatility and Performance model to identify likely causes based on the extracted cost data and research findings
3. Analysis step titled "Generate Action Plan" using Fast Response model to create immediate action plan with containment, investigation, resolution, and prevention measures
4. Analysis step titled "Alert" using Fast Response model to create concise alert message with issue summary, root cause, top 3 actions, and call-to-action

```

 **Step 4: Reasoning Group**
+ Title: *Anomaly Detection*
+ Run these steps: Once
+ Reasoning instructions: If cost anomaly detected in @Extract CUDOS Cost Data above @Alert Threshold, then run investigation and remediation steps. If no significant anomaly, skip detailed analysis.

 **Step 4.1: Web Search Output**
+ Title: *Research Causes*
+ Prompt:

```
Research AWS cost spike causes for services identified in @Extract CUDOS Cost Data. Find common root causes, resolution best practices, and prevention strategies.

```

 **Step 4.3: General Knowledge - Fast Response**
+ Title: *Generate Action Plan*
+ Prompt:

```
Create immediate action plan based on @Root Cause Analysis. Include: 1) Immediate containment steps, 2) Investigation procedures, 3) Resolution actions, 4) Prevention measures.
```

 **Step 4.4: General Knowledge - Fast Response**
+ Title: *Alert*
+ Prompt:

```
Create a concise cost alert message using this template. Keep total message under 200 words, prioritize by biggest cost impact, use clear business language:

"🚨 Cost Spike Alert

ISSUE: [Extract top cost anomaly from @Extract CUDOS Cost Data with $ amount and % increase]

ROOT CAUSE: [Summarize main driver from @Root Cause Analysis in 1-2 sentences]

IMMEDIATE ACTION: [List top 3 actions from @Generate Action Plan, ranked by impact]

THRESHOLD: @Alert Threshold exceeded

PERIOD: @Analysis Time Period

[End with clear next step for reader]"

Make it scannable with bullet points, focus on dollar impact, and end with a specific call-to-action like "Review detailed analysis in CUDOS dashboard".
```
