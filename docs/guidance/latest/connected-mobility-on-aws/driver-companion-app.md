# What it can do
<a name="driver-companion-app"></a>
+  **Claim a vehicle.** A driver claims their assigned vehicle, so that trips, safety events, and driver scores are attributed to them without an operator reassigning it.
+  **See the vehicle live.** Location, state, tire pressure, battery or fuel, and trip history, updated as telemetry arrives.
+  **Control the vehicle remotely.** Lock the doors, start the vehicle, precondition the cabin, flash the hazards, find the vehicle, open the charge door, and trigger the panic alarm, from a controls sheet that shows whatever the vehicle supports.
+  **Get alerts.** Diagnostic trouble codes, safety events, triage outcomes, and agent findings, with push notifications that open the relevant alert.
+  **Book service.** Service history, nearby service centers or dealers, and appointment booking.
+  **Talk to the vehicle assistant.** A speech-to-speech assistant that answers questions about the vehicle, explains alerts, and books service, with the tools it used shown on screen.
+  **Shop for the next vehicle.** For tenants that enable it, a Buy tab covering discovery, configuration, financing, reservations, and order tracking.

## Screens
<a name="companion-tabs"></a>

| Tab | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Home | Vehicle summary and quick actions, including claiming an assigned vehicle. |
| Vehicle | Live telemetry, vehicle state, trip history, health detail, and the remote controls sheet. |
| Alerts | Diagnostic trouble codes, safety events, triage outcomes, and agent findings. |
| Service | Service history and appointment booking. Labelled **Dealer** for OEM tenants, whose drivers are routed to authorized dealerships; fleet and rental tenants keep the service label. |
| Buy | The vehicle shopping journey. Present only for tenants whose configuration enables it. |
| Account | Driver profile, settings, and notification consent. |

The assistant is not a tab. It opens full screen from anywhere in the app, so a conversation starts in the context the driver is already in. The Service tab’s **Book Service** action opens it with a primed prompt, so the conversation begins as though the driver had asked out loud.
