# Operator surface: unified Diagnostic Triage panel
<a name="rd-operator-surface"></a>

 **Run diagnostic scan** is enabled only while the vehicle’s connection status is `connected`. The scan reads DTCs from each ECU on the vehicle’s powertrain profile in turn, and the panel shows which ECU it is reading as the sidecar reports progress. When the scan finishes, the panel lists the DTC count for each ECU, marks the ECUs that returned a freeze frame, and updates the open-fault summary and the time of the last scan.

The vehicle-detail **Diagnostic Triage** panel is the primary operator entry point for the remote-diagnostics stack. It unifies four surfaces the earlier UI split across separate buttons:
+  **DTC catalog verdicts** — every DTC code rendered against a live event-catalog lookup. An uncatalog code renders with no fabricated severity — never a placeholder default — so operators can distinguish a benign uncatalog code from a red-flagged one.
+  **Powertrain-correct UDS/SOVD scans** — the underlying sim (and, on real vehicles, the ECU roster resolver) uses a per-vehicle powertrain profile (gasoline, diesel, hybrid, electric) so a battery-electric vehicle is never asked for engine or EVAP-system DTCs. `read_dtcs` with `components: ["*"]` returns only the ECUs the profile actually addresses.
+  **ECU identity and version drift** — `read_identity` responses feed a compare view that flags where a vehicle’s on-vehicle part numbers or software versions differ from the fleet’s expected baseline.
+  **Safety-classified routines disclosure** — routines are grouped by their server-derived safety class (see [Safety envelope for remote actuation](rd-safety.md)) so the operator sees what can be run here (`INERT`), what needs the vehicle stationary (`STATIONARY`), and what is handled downstream at a dealership (`SERVICE_ONLY`).

 `SERVICE_ONLY` routines render **no invocation control at all** — not a disabled button. A disabled button is still a hover-tooltip UI; an absent control makes the affordance boundary structural. Refusal reasons, when a routine is refused server-side, render verbatim from the deterministic catalog — no client-side summarization, no fabricated placeholder text.

The fleet-operator persona reads the vehicle’s diagnostic state on this panel and decides whether to keep the vehicle running (issue a `clear_dtcs` if the underlying repair is complete and attested) or dispatch it to a technician (see [Cross-platform diagnostic sessions](rd-cross-platform-sessions.md)). Repair work itself is not performed from this surface.
