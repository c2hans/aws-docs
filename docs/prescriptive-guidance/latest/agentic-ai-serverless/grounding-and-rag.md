# Grounding and Retrieval Augmented Generation
<a name="grounding-and-rag"></a>

Trust, accuracy, and explainability are essential to deploying AI systems in enterprise production environments. Foundation models (FMs) offer impressive general capabilities. However, they're trained on large-scale public corpora and often lack awareness of proprietary data, business rules, or recent changes.

To address these awareness gaps, AWS enables *Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)* through Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases. RAG is a powerful architectural pattern that grounds FM responses in external, domain-specific knowledge, delivering both factual accuracy and contextual relevance.

RAG enhances large language model (LLM) output by combining two processes:
+ **Retrieve** – Use a semantic search mechanism (typically powered by vector embeddings) to identify relevant content from a curated knowledge source (for example, internal documents, product manuals, and case logs).
+ **Generate** – Provide the retrieved context as part of the prompt to the LLM, allowing it to craft an answer grounded in that authoritative information.

This approach enables "closed-book" foundation models to act as if they had access to your live, curated enterprise data, without retraining.

For example, an employee asks an internal AI assistant "What's our travel policy?" The assistant's answer is created by using human resources (HR) documentation that's hosted in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3), without needing to fine-tune a model.

## Grounding in Amazon Bedrock
<a name="grounding-in-9999999999999999br-.ccc488b6-a1d1-5095-9919-b2536e5f62ff"></a>

Amazon Bedrock supports grounding through its [Knowledge Bases](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/knowledge-base.html) feature, allowing developers to configure and link enterprise content repositories to foundation models without managing infrastructure.

Key capabilities of grounding in Amazon Bedrock include the following:
+ **Automated embedding** of documents using supported FM providers
+ **Semantic search** across PDFs, HTML, Word documents, or text files stored in Amazon S3
+ **Grounding without fine-tuning** because content is injected into the LLM's context window
+ **Works with **Amazon Bedrock** Agents** to perform complex reasoning or multi-step tool use

Supported sources of grounding in Amazon Bedrock Knowledge Bases include the following:
+ Amazon S3 (native support), and Confluence, Salesforce, SharePoint, or Web Crawler (in preview)
+ Pre-embedded indexes by using vector stores such as Amazon Aurora, Amazon OpenSearch Serverless, Amazon Neptune Analytics, MongoDB, Pinecone, and Redis Enterprise Cloud.

Model support of grounding in Amazon Bedrock includes the following:
+ All LLMs that are compatible with Amazon Bedrock support grounding.
+ Amazon Nova models are optimized for grounding across text, image, and video by using hybrid retrieval techniques.
+ Grounded output can be further orchestrated by Amazon Bedrock agents for reasoning and decision-making.

## Integration with agentic AI
<a name="integration-with-agentic-ai.7ba2de27-0d65-5e78-8d24-9d6673e70d1d"></a>

RAG works especially well with Amazon Bedrock agents by enabling them to act with contextual intelligence and policy awareness. Following is an example of an agentic workflow:

1. User input is sent to Amazon EventBridge, which sends it to an Amazon Bedrock agent.

1. The agent invokes a knowledge base to search internal documents.

1. Retrieved context is embedded into the LLM prompt.

1. The LLM generates grounded output with references and traceability.

1. (Optional) The Agent stores output and supporting evidence in memory for future actions.

This workflow allows the agent to reason over grounded context and make explainable decisions, bridging the gap between general-purpose intelligence and domain-specific application.

## Adding guardrails for safety and compliance
<a name="adding-guardrails-for-safety-and-compliance.4d5017e4-a0e5-5805-8f57-88dbdda82ddf"></a>

Grounding enhances accuracy, but production-grade AI demands explicit controls for what the model can and cannot say or do. The [Amazon Bedrock Guardrails](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/guardrails.html) feature constrains agent behavior and enforce enterprise policy.

Capabilities of guardrails include the following:
+ **Content filters** – Prevent outputs that violate safety or compliance standards, including masking personal identifiable information.
+ **Denial topics** – Block specific categories of responses (for example, no medical advice).
+ **Prompt inspection** – Identify and strip sensitive inputs before inference.
+ **User-level access control** – Tailor responses based on identity and roles by using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM).
+ **Session context constraints** – Prevent model drift by scoping the agent to a specific task.

With guardrails, organizations can safely delegate reasoning and decision-making to agents while retaining control over tone, behavior, and boundaries.

## Automated reasoning in addition to RAG
<a name="automated-reasoning-in-addition-to-rag.7090540a-95da-5b2c-9f59-3cf0c74f5b4b"></a>

Grounded content is not enough. Agents must reason over that content. This is where LLM-based automated reasoning becomes critical. Automated reasoning focuses on enabling agents to reason logically, such as drawing conclusions, making decisions, or solving problems, without direct human intervention.

Automated reasoning enables the following:
+ **Synthesis** – Compare, contrast, or summarize multiple retrieved documents.
+ **Multi-hop logic** – Connect facts across documents or sections to draw conclusions.
+ **Decision-making** – Choose between conflicting data based on rules or preferences.
+ **Evidence-based responses** – Output citations and justification for every decision.

These capabilities transform a grounded response into a reasoned answer, and an Amazon Bedrock agent from a retrieval tool into a domain-aware advisor.

With tools like prompt chaining, reflection-evaluation loops, and multi-agent orchestration, agentic AI systems can simulate expert reasoning patterns, such as diagnosis, triage, planning, or risk analysis.

## Amazon Nova models and grounded generation

With Amazon Nova Pro and Amazon Nova Premier, grounded RAG workflows extend into multimodal inputs, enabling agents to interpret and reason across the following sources:
+ Annotated documents and PDF files
+ Diagrams, charts, and embedded images
+ Screenshots, forms, and structured data visualizations
+ Video transcripts and slide decks

This capability makes Amazon Nova uniquely suited for industries that require deep understanding of rich media content, such as legal casework, insurance assessments, clinical records, or regulatory filings.

## Security and governance in RAG
<a name="security-and-governance-in-rag.a49c2656-a5f2-525c-bcc1-307e2342a55f"></a>

Grounding enterprise models introduces, such as through RAG, knowledge bases, or fine-tuning new responsibilities. You're injecting your own data and context into a foundation model. This introduces new responsibilities beyond just model selection and prompt crafting. AWS recommends the following controls, which work together with guardrails to support confident enterprise deployment:
+ **Source data quality assurance** - Grounded responses are only as reliable as the documents, databases, or APIs that they're based on.
+ **Data classification and traceability** – Classify and tag content sources, to show where a grounded response came from.
+ **Access control** – Injecting private documents into prompts raises security and privacy risks. Restrict access to specific documents or embeddings through IAM.
+ **Update and drift management** – Grounded knowledge must evolve with your business. There must be versioning, freshness policies, and automated reindexing to prevent drift or stale information in model outputs.
+ **Governance of embedded intelligence** – You're now deploying organizational knowledge by using AI. That capability comes with the duty to validate, monitor, and govern how it's expressed, especially in regulated domains such as healthcare and finance.
+ **Prompt observability** – Grounded systems must respect IP rights, regulatory requirements, and corporate disclaimers. Capture full prompt, context, and response chains for compliance.
+ **Audit logging** – Track retrieval and inference through AWS CloudTrail and structured CloudWatch logs.
+ **User feedback and correction loops** – Enterprises are responsible for enabling users to flag bad grounding, incorrect answers, or irrelevant sources, and to route that feedback to improve future relevance.
+ **Memory control** – Choose whether to persist inferred insights over sessions.
+ **Token budget optimization** – When grounding adds large chunks of text, it increases token usage (and cost). You must balance RAG precision and prompt economy, often through chunking, summarization, or metadata filtering.

## Summary of grounding and RAG
<a name="summary-of-grounding-and-rag.07a23280-205a-550a-ae52-97c70831d6cf"></a>

RAG is a foundational strategy for safe and scalable enterprise AI. By grounding foundation models in authoritative internal knowledge, RAG transforms large language models from general-purpose generators into domain-aware, policy-aligned, and explainable AI assistants. This approach reduces hallucinations, enforces compliance with internal policies, and enables fact-based, contextual responses—making generative AI suitable for both customer- and employee-facing applications.

When combined with automated reasoning and guardrails, grounded models become not just tools, but accountable and trusted agents. With Amazon Bedrock serverless RAG support and Amazon Nova multimodal capabilities, organizations can scale secure, high-performance AI across their business without managing infrastructure.
