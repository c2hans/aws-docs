# Migrate an on-premises PostgreSQL database to Aurora PostgreSQL
<a name="migrate-an-on-premises-postgresql-database-to-aurora-postgresql"></a>

*Baji Shaik and Jitender Kumar, Amazon Web Services*

## Summary
<a name="migrate-an-on-premises-postgresql-database-to-aurora-postgresql-summary"></a>

Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition combines the performance and availability of high-end commercial databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open-source databases. Aurora provides these benefits by scaling storage across three Availability Zones in the same AWS Region, and supports up to 15 read replica instances for scaling out read workloads and providing high availability within a single Region. By using an Aurora global database, you can replicate PostgreSQL databases in up to five Regions for remote read access and disaster recovery in the event of a Region failure. This pattern describes the steps for migrating an on-premises PostgreSQL source database to an Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible database. The pattern includes two migration options: using AWS Data Migration Service (AWS DMS) or using native PostgreSQL tools (such as [pg\_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html), [pg\_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html), and [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html)) or third-party tools.

The steps described in this pattern also apply to target PostgreSQL databases on Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances.

## Prerequisites and limitations

**Limitations**
+ Database size limits are 64 TB for Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and 128 TB for Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible.

## Tools
<a name="migrate-an-on-premises-postgresql-database-to-aurora-postgresql-tools"></a>
+ [AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/Welcome.html) helps you migrate data stores into the AWS Cloud or between combinations of cloud and on-premises configurations. This service supports different sources and target databases. For information about how to validate the PostgreSQL source and target database versions and editions supported for use with AWS DMS, see [Using a PostgreSQL database as an AWS DMS source](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_Source.PostgreSQL.html). We recommend that you use the latest version of AWS DMS for the most comprehensive version and feature support.
+ Native PostgreSQL tools include  [pg\_dump](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgdump.html), [pg\_restore](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-pgrestore.html), and [psql](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html).
