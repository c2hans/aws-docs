## Summary
<a name="migrate-an-on-premises-vm-to-amazon-ec2-by-using-aws-application-migration-service-summary"></a>

When it comes to application migration, organizations can take different approaches to rehost (lift and shift) the application’s servers from the on-premises environment to the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Cloud. One way is to provision new Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances and then install and configure the application from scratch. Another approach is to use third-party or AWS native migration services to migrate multiple servers at the same time.

This pattern outlines the steps for migrating a supported virtual machine (VM) to an Amazon EC2 instance on the AWS Cloud by using AWS Application Migration Service. You can use the approach in this pattern to migrate one or multiple virtual machines manually, one by one, or automatically by creating appropriate automation scripts based on the outlined steps.

## Prerequisites and limitations
<a name="migrate-an-on-premises-vm-to-amazon-ec2-by-using-aws-application-migration-service-prereqs"></a>

**Prerequisites**
+ An active AWS account in one of the AWS Regions that support Application Migration Service
+ Network connectivity between the source server and target EC2 server through a private network by using AWS Direct Connect or a virtual private network (VPN), or through the internet

**Limitations**
+ For the latest list of supported Regions, see the [Supported AWS Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/supported-regions.html).
+ For a list of supported operating systems, see the [Supported operating systems](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/Supported-Operating-Systems.html) and the *General *section of [Amazon EC2 FAQs](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/faqs/).

## Architecture
<a name="migrate-an-on-premises-vm-to-amazon-ec2-by-using-aws-application-migration-service-architecture"></a>

**Source technology stack**
+ A physical, virtual, or cloud-hosted server running an operating system supported by Amazon EC2

**Target technology stack**
+ An Amazon EC2 instance running the same operating system as the source VM
+ Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS)

**Source and target architecture**

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture and main components of the solution. In the on-premises data center, there are virtual machines with local disks. On AWS, there is a staging area with replication servers and a migrated resources area with EC2 instances for test and cutover. Both subnets contain EBS volumes.

![Main components to migrate a supported VM to an Amazon EC2 instance on the AWS Cloud.](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/patterns/images/pattern-img/58c8bafd-9a6d-42d4-a5ce-08c4b9a286a3/images/f8396fad-7ee9-4f75-800f-e819f509e151.png)

1. Initialize AWS Application Migration Service.

1. Set up the staging area server configuration and reporting, including staging area resources.

1. Install agents on source servers, and use continuous block-level data replication (compressed and encrypted).

1. Automate orchestration and system conversion to shorten the cutover window.

**Network architecture**

The following diagram shows the high-level architecture and main components of the solution from the networking perspective, including required protocols and ports for communication between primary components in the on-premises data center and on AWS.

## Tools
<a name="migrate-an-on-premises-vm-to-amazon-ec2-by-using-aws-application-migration-service-tools"></a>
+ [AWS Application Migration Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/mgn/latest/ug/what-is-application-migration-service.html) helps you rehost (*lift and shift*) applications to the AWS Cloud without change and with minimal downtime.

## Best practices
<a name="migrate-an-on-premises-vm-to-amazon-ec2-by-using-aws-application-migration-service-best-practices"></a>
+ Do not take the source server offline or perform a reboot until the cutover to the target EC2 instance is complete.
+ Provide ample opportunity for the users to perform user acceptance testing (UAT) on the target server to identify and resolve any issues. Ideally, this testing should start at least two weeks before cutover.
+ Frequently monitor the server replication status on the Application Migration Service console to identify issues early on.
+ Use temporary AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) credentials for agent installation instead of permanent IAM user credentials.

### Generate AWS credentials
<a name="generate-aws-credentials"></a>

| Task | Description | Skills required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Create the AWS Replication Agent IAM role. | Sign in with administrative permissions to the AWS account.<br />On the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) [console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/), create an IAM role:1. On the IAM console, choose **Roles**.<br />2. Choose **Create role**.<br />3. On the **Select trusted entity** page,** **in** Trusted entity type** section, select **AWS Account**.<br />4. In the **An AWS account** section, select **This account (<*account-id>*)**.<br />5. Choose **Next**.<br />6. On the** Add permissions **page, search for the `AWSApplicationMigrationAgentInstallationPolicy` policy, select the check box next to the policy name.<br />7. Choose **Next**.<br />8. On the **Role details** page, enter **MGN\_Agent\_Installation\_Role** as the role name.<br />9. Verify that the fields are correct, and then choose **Create role**. | AWS administrator, Migration engineer |
| Generate temporary security credentials. | On a machine with AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) installed, sign in with administrative permissions. Or alternatively (within a supported AWS Region), on the AWS Management Console, sign in with administrative permissions to the AWS account, and open AWS CloudShell.<br />Generate temporary credentials with the following command, replacing `<account-id>` with the AWS account ID.<br />`aws sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::<account-id>:role/MGN_Agent_Installation_Role --role-session-name mgn_installation_session_role`<br />From the output of the command, copy the values for `AccessKeyId`,** **`SecretAccessKey`, and** **`SessionToken`.** **Store them in a safe location for later use.These temporary credentials will expire after one hour. If you need credentials after one hour, repeat the previous steps. | AWS administrator, Migration engineer |
