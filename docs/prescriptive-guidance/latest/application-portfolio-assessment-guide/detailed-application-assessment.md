# Detailed application assessment
<a name="detailed-application-assessment"></a>

The goal of a detailed application assessment is the complete understanding of the targeted application and its associated infrastructure (compute, storage, and network). High-fidelity data is necessary to avoid pitfalls. For example, it is common for organizations to assume that they fully understand the application. This is natural, and it's true in many cases. However, to minimize risk to the business, it is important to validate institutional knowledge and static documentation by obtaining programmatic data as much as possible. This will take care of the heavy lifting of the discovery process. You can focus on the data elements that come from alternative sources, such as business-specific information, strategic roadmaps, and others.

The key is to avoid last-minute changes during and after migration. For example, when migrating, it's important to minimize changes based on unidentified dependencies that might require the inclusion of a server into an ongoing migration wave. Shortly after migration, it's important to minimize changes based on the associated platform requirements to allow traffic or deploy additional services. These kinds of unplanned changes increase the risk of security and operational issues. We highly recommend using programmatic discovery tooling to validate traffic patterns and dependencies when performing detailed application assessments.

At the beginning of the assessment, you must identify the application stakeholders. These are typically the following:
+ Business unit leads
+ Application owners
+ Architects
+ Operations and support
+ Cloud-enablement teams
+ Specific platform teams such as compute, storage, and networks

There are two approaches for detailed discovery. Top-down discovery starts with the application, or even with the user, and goes all the way down to the infrastructure. This is the recommended approach when the identification of the application is clear. Conversely, bottom-up discovery starts with the infrastructure and goes all the way up to the application or service and its users. This approach is useful when migration programs are driven by infrastructure teams and when application-to-infrastructure mapping is unclear. In general, you are likely to use a combination of both.

To dive deep into an application, existing architecture diagrams are good start. If these are not available, create one based on current knowledge. Do not underestimate the importance of this task, even for simple rehost migration strategies. Plotting architectural diagrams helps you to identify inefficiencies that can be quickly addressed with minor changes when in the cloud.

Depending on whether you are performing a top-down or bottom-up approach, the initial diagram will plot application components and services or infrastructure components such as servers and load balancers. After the main components and interfaces have been identified, validate them with programmatic data from discovery tools and application performance monitoring tools. The tools must support dependency analysis and provide communication information between components. Each component that makes up this application must be identified. Next, document dependencies to other applications and services, both internal and external.

In the absence of tooling to validate dependencies and mapping, a manual approach is required. For example, you can log into infrastructure components and run scripts to collect communication information such as open ports and established connections. Likewise, you can identify running processes and installed software. Don't underestimate the effort required for manual discovery. Agentic AI tools, such as [Kiro](https://kiro.dev/), can help you build scripts and analyze data outputs. Programmatic tooling can capture and report most dependencies in a few days, except those that occur at greater intervals (typically a small percentage). Manual discovery can take weeks to collect and merge all data points, and it can still be prone to errors and missing data.

Proceed to obtain the information specified in the [data requirements](understanding-detailed-assessment-data-requirements.md) section for each prioritized application and the mapped infrastructure. Next, use the following questionnaire to guide you through the detailed assessment process. Meet with the identified stakeholders to obtain and discuss the answers to these questions.
