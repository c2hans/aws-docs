# Understanding complete assessment data requirements
<a name="understanding-complete-assessment-data-requirements"></a>

The following table describes the information required to obtain a complete portfolio view of the applications in the migration and their associated infrastructure.

The tables use the following abbreviations:
+ R, for required
+ O, for optional
+ N/A, for not applicable

## Applications

| Dependencies | Upstream and downstream dependencies to internal and external applications or services. Non-technical dependencies such as operational elements (for example, maintenance cycles). | R | O | High |
| Infrastructure mapping | Mapping to physical and/or virtual assets that make up the application | R | R | High |
| License | Commodity software license type (for example, Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise) | R | R | Medium-high |
