# Understanding initial assessment data requirements
<a name="understanding-initial-assessment-data-requirements"></a>

Data collection can take a significant amount of time and easily become a blocker when there is no clarity about what data is needed and when it is needed. The key is to understand the balance between what is too little and what is too much data for the outcomes of this stage. To focus on the data and the fidelity level required for this early stage of portfolio assessment, adopt an iterative approach to data collection.

## Data sources and data requirements
<a name="data-sources-data-requirements"></a>

The first step is to identify your sources of data. Start by identifying the key stakeholders within your organization that can fulfill the data requirements. These are typically members of the service management, operations, capacity planning, monitoring, and support teams, and the application owners. Establish working sessions with members of these groups. Communicate data requirements and obtain a list of tools and existing documentation that can provide the data.

To guide these conversations, use the following set of questions:
+ How accurate and up to date is the current infrastructure and application inventory? For example, for the company configuration management database (CMDB), do we already know where the gaps are?
+ Do we have active tools and processes that keep the CMDB (or equivalent) updated? If so, how frequently it is updated? What is the latest refresh date?
+ Does the current documentation, such as the CMDB or equivalent, contain application-to-infrastructure mapping? Is each infrastructure asset associated to an application? Is each application mapped to infrastructure?
+ Does the documentation contain a catalog of licenses and licensing agreements for each product?
+ Does the documentation contain dependency data? Note the existence of communication data such as server to server, application to application, application or server to database.
+ What other tools that can provide application and infrastructure information are available in the environment? Note the existence of performance, monitoring, repositories, knowledge bases, and management tools that can be used as a source of data.
+ What are the different locations, such as data centers, hosting our applications and infrastructure?

After these questions have been answered, list your identified sources of data. Then assign a level of fidelity, or level of trust, to each of them. Data validated recently (within 30 days) from active programmatic sources, such as tools, have the highest level of fidelity. Static data is considered of lower fidelity and less trusted. Examples of static data are documents, workbooks, manually updated CMDBs, or any other non-programmatically maintained dataset, or whose last refresh date is older than 60 days.

The data fidelity levels in the following table are provided as examples. We recommend that you assess the requirements of your organization in terms of maximum tolerance to assumptions and associated risk to determine what is an appropriate level of fidelity. In the table, institutional knowledge refers to any information about applications and infrastructure that is not documented.

|
|
| **Data sources** | **Fidelity level assessment** | **Portfolio coverage** | **Comments** |
| --- |--- |--- |--- |
| Institutional knowledge | Low - Up to 25% of accurate data, 75% assumed values or data is older than 150 days. | Low | Scarce, focused on critical applications |
| Knowledge base | Medium-low - 35-40% of accurate data, 65-60% assumed values or data is 120-150 days old. | Medium | Manually maintained, inconsistent levels of detail |
| CMDB | Medium - \~50% of accurate data, \~50% assumed values or data is 90-120 days old. | Medium | Contains data from mixed sources, several data gaps |
| VMware vCenter exports | Medium-high - 75-80% of accurate data, 25-20% assumed values or data is 60-90 days old. | High | Covers 90% of the virtualized estate |
| Application performance monitoring | High - Mostly accurate data, \~5% assumed values or data is 0-60 days old. | Low | Limited to critical production systems (covers 15% of the application portfolio) |

The following tables specify the required and optional data attributes for each asset class (applications, infrastructure, networks, and migration), the specific activity (inventory or business case), and the recommended data fidelity for this stage of assessment. The tables use the following abbreviations:
+ R, for required
+ (D), for directional business case, required for total cost of ownership (TCO) comparisons and directional business cases
+ (F), for full directional business case, required for TCO comparison and directional business cases that include migration and modernization costs
+ O, for optional
+ N/A, for not applicable

## Evaluating the need for discovery tooling
<a name="discovery-tooling"></a>

Does your organization need discovery tooling? Portfolio assessment requires high-confidence, up-to-date data about applications and infrastructure. Initial stages of portfolio assessment can use assumptions to fill data gaps. However, as progress is made, high-fidelity data helps you create successful migration plans and correctly estimate the target infrastructure to reduce costs and maximize benefits. It also reduces risk by enabling implementations that consider dependencies and avoids migration pitfalls. The primary use case for discovery tooling in cloud migration programs is to reduce risk and increase confidence levels in data through the following:
+ Automated or programmatic data collection, resulting in validated, highly trusted data
+ Acceleration of the rate at which data is obtained, improving project speed and reducing costs
+ Increased levels of data completeness, including communication data and dependencies not typically available in CMDBs
+ Obtaining insights such as automated application identification, TCO analysis, projected run rates, and optimization recommendations
+ High-confidence migration wave planning

When there is uncertainty about whether systems exist in a given location, most discovery tools can scan network subnets and discover those systems that respond to ping or Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) requests. Note that not all network or systems configurations will allow ping or SNMP traffic. Discuss these options with your network and technical teams.

Further stages of application portfolio assessment and migration heavily rely on accurate dependency-mapping information. Dependency mapping provides an understanding of the infrastructure and configuration that will be required in AWS (such as security groups, instance types, account placement, and network routing). It also helps with grouping applications that must move at the same time (such as applications that must communicate over low latency networks).

When deciding on a discovery tool, it is important to consider all stages of the assessment process and to anticipate data requirements. Data gaps have the potential to become blockers, so it is key to anticipate those by analyzing future data requirements and data sources. Experience in the field dictates that most stalled migration projects have a limited dataset in which the applications in scope, associated infrastructure, and their dependencies are not clearly identified. This lack of identification can lead to incorrect metrics, decisions, and delays. Obtaining up-to-date data is the first step to successful migration projects.

### How to select a discovery tool?
<a name="how-to-select-a-discovery-tool-.7f053e2e-720e-5fcb-9ef3-75fcf1ec0c60"></a>

Several discovery tools in the market provide different features and capabilities. Consider your requirements. And decide on the most appropriate option for your organization. The most common factors when deciding on a discovery tool for migrations are the following:

#### Security
<a name="security.ca1dcd3e-ac39-5ada-932e-dd8ef99c3dd7"></a>
+ What data is collected by the tool?
+ What is the authentication method to access the tool data repository or analytics engines?
+ Who can access the data, and what are the security controls to access the tool?
+ How does the tool collect data? Does it need dedicated credentials?
+ What credentials and access level does the tool need to access my systems and obtain data?
+ How is data transferred between the tool components?
+ Does the tool support data encryption at rest and in-transit?
+ Is data centralized in a single component inside or outside of my environment?
+ What are the network and firewall requirements?

Ensure that security teams are involved in early conversations about discovery tooling.

#### Data sovereignty
<a name="data-sovereignty.b93cc702-d64a-5d88-84fd-e8f2a35b32e9"></a>
+ Where is the data stored and processed?
+ Does the tool use a software as a service (SaaS) model?
+ Does it have the possibility to retain all data within the boundaries of my environment?
+ Can data be screened before it leaves the boundaries of my organization?

Consider your organization needs in terms of data residency requirements.

#### Architecture
<a name="architecture.41e0999c-b525-5067-a9a1-259538ff9769"></a>
+ What infrastructure is required to deploy the tool, and what are the different components?
+ Is more than one architecture or deployment model available?
+ Does the tool support installing components in air-locked security zones?

#### Performance
<a name="performance.319e152d-0412-5742-bf14-38fe89f3fbfb"></a>
+ What is the impact of data collection on my systems?

#### Compatibility and scope
<a name="compatibility-and-scope.762cde2e-83a4-5a81-a480-f336ce7df656"></a>
+ Does the tool support all or most of my products and versions?  Review the tool documentation to verify supported platforms against the current information about your scope.
+ Are most of my operating systems supported for data collection?  If you don't know your operating system versions, try to narrow the list of discovery tools to those with the wider range of supported systems.

#### Collection methods
<a name="collection-methods.166f8e0b-fa87-5fae-9bde-f4a652cdaa63"></a>
+ Does the tool require to install an agent on each targeted system?
+ Does it support agent-less data collection?
+ Do agent and agent-less provide the same features?
+ What is the collection process?

#### Features
<a name="features.506b3744-2123-5715-a267-816c8a04ee6b"></a>
+ What are the features available?
+ Can it calculate total cost of ownership (TCO) and estimated AWS Cloud run rate?
+ Does it support migration planning?
+ Does it measure performance?
+ Can it recommend target AWS infrastructure?
+ Does it perform dependency mapping?
+ What level of dependency mapping does it provide?
+ Does it provide API access? (for example, can it be programmatically accessed to obtain data?)

Consider tools with strong application and infrastructure dependency-mapping functions and those that can infer applications from communication patterns.

#### Cost
<a name="cost.4a688c13-38a6-539f-a6c1-ff8170b57428"></a>
+ What is the licensing model?
+ How much does the licensing cost?
+ Is the pricing for each server? Is it tiered pricing?
+ Are there any options with limited features that can be licensed on-demand?

Discovery tools are typically used throughout the entire lifecycle of migration projects. If your budget is limited, consider at least 6 months. However, absence of discovery tooling typically leads to higher manual effort and internal costs.

#### Support model
<a name="support-model.dd303306-6f2f-5dd0-b101-7bc1d52541f5"></a>
+ What levels of support are provided by default?
+ Is any support plan available?
+ What are the incident response times?

#### Professional services
<a name="professional-services.ab7f9d7f-86bd-554a-a260-12c3fa158de4"></a>
+ Does the vendor offer professional services to analyze discovery outputs?
+ Can they cover the elements of this guide?
+ Are there any discounts or bundles for tooling \+ services?

### Recommended features for the discovery tool
<a name="recommended-features-for-the-discovery-tool.6238fa9f-5d63-5644-8f81-bfe56983716b"></a>

To avoid provisioning and combining data from multiple tools over time, a discovery tool should cover the following minimum features:
+ **Software** – The discovery tool should be able to identify running processes and installed runtimes, packages, and frameworks.
+ **Dependency mapping** – It should be able to collect network connection information and build inbound and outbound dependency maps of the servers and running applications. Also, the discovery tool should be able to infer applications from groups of infrastructure based on communication patterns.
+ **Profile and configuration discovery** – It should be able to report the infrastructure profile such as CPU family (for example, x86, PowerPC), the number of CPU cores, memory size, number of disks and size, and network interfaces.
+ **Network storage discovery** – It should be able to detect and profile network shares from network-attached storage (NAS).
+ **Database discovery** – It should be able to discover databases, instances, and schemas, including engine types and versions.
+ **Performance** – It should be able to report peak and average utilization of CPU, memory, disk, and network.
+ **Gap analysis** – It should be able to provide insights on data quantity and fidelity.
+ **Network scanning** – It should be able to scan network subnets and discover unknown infrastructure assets.
+ **Reporting** – It should be able to provide collection and analysis status.
+ **API access** – It should be able to provide programmatic means to access collected data.

### Additional features to consider
<a name="additional-features-to-consider.3b3d9070-dc00-573f-b329-131c04c36b65"></a>
+ **TCO analysis** to provide a cost comparison between current on-premises cost and projected AWS cost.
+ **Licensing analysis and optimization recommendations** for Microsoft SQL Server and Oracle systems in rehost and replatform scenarios.
+ **Migration strategy recommendation** (Can the discovery tool make default migration R type recommendations based on current technology?)
+ **Inventory export** (to CSV or a similar format)
+ **Right-sizing recommendation** (for example, can it map a recommended target AWS infrastructure?)
+ **Dependency visualization** (for example, can dependency mapping be visualized in a graphical mode?)
+ **Architectural view** (for example, can architectural diagrams be automatically produced?)
+ **Application prioritization** (Can it assign weight or relevance to application and infrastructure attributes to create prioritization criteria for migration?)
+ **Wave planning** (for example, recommended groups of applications and help creating migration wave plans)
+ **Migration cost estimation** (estimation of effort to migrate)

### Deployment considerations
<a name="deployment-considerations.190fc468-3861-5cc4-9340-fb737d1ea58d"></a>

After you have selected and procured a discovery tool, consider the following questions to drive conversations with the teams responsible for deploying the tool in your organization:
+ Are servers or applications operated by a third party? This could dictate the teams to involve and processes to follow.
+ What is the high-level process for gaining approval to deploy discovery tools?
+ What is the main authentication process to access systems such as servers, containers, storage, and databases? Are server credentials local or centralized? What is the process to obtain credentials? Credentials will be required to collect data from your systems (for example, containers, virtual or physical servers, hypervisors, and databases). Obtaining credentials for the discovery tool to connect to each asset can be challenging, especially when these assets are not centralized.
+ What is the network security zones outline? Are network diagrams available?
+ What is the process for requesting firewall rules in the data centers?
+ What are the current support service-level agreements (SLAs) in relation to data center operations (discovery tool installation, firewall requests)?
