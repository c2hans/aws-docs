 ** ETag **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-CompletedPart-ETag"></a>
Entity tag returned when the part was uploaded.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** PartNumber **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-CompletedPart-PartNumber"></a>
Part number that identifies the part. This is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000.
+  **General purpose buckets** - In `CompleteMultipartUpload`, when a additional checksum (including `x-amz-checksum-crc32`, `x-amz-checksum-crc32c`, `x-amz-checksum-sha1`, or `x-amz-checksum-sha256`) is applied to each part, the `PartNumber` must start at 1 and the part numbers must be consecutive. Otherwise, Amazon S3 generates an HTTP `400 Bad Request` status code and an `InvalidPartOrder` error code.
+  **Directory buckets** - In `CompleteMultipartUpload`, the `PartNumber` must start at 1 and the part numbers must be consecutive.
Type: Integer
