 ** ChecksumCRC32 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumCRC32"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `CRC32` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumCRC32C **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumCRC32C"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32C` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `CRC32C` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumCRC64NVME **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumCRC64NVME"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 64-bit `CRC64NVME` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `CRC64NVME` checksum algorithm, or if the object was uploaded without a checksum (and Amazon S3 added the default checksum, `CRC64NVME`, to the uploaded object). For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumMD5 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumMD5"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 128-bit `MD5` digest of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `MD5` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumSHA1 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumSHA1"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 160-bit `SHA1` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `SHA1` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumSHA256 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumSHA256"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 256-bit `SHA256` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `SHA256` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumSHA512 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumSHA512"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 512-bit `SHA512` digest of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `SHA512` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumXXHASH128 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumXXHASH128"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 128-bit `XXHASH128` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `XXHASH128` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumXXHASH3 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumXXHASH3"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 64-bit `XXHASH3` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `XXHASH3` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumXXHASH64 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-ObjectPart-ChecksumXXHASH64"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 64-bit `XXHASH64` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `XXHASH64` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
