 ** ChecksumCRC32 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-Part-ChecksumCRC32"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the object was uploaded with the `CRC32` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumCRC32C **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-Part-ChecksumCRC32C"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 32-bit `CRC32C` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the object was uploaded with the `CRC32C` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumCRC64NVME **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-Part-ChecksumCRC64NVME"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 64-bit `CRC64NVME` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `CRC64NVME` checksum algorithm, or if the object was uploaded without a checksum (and Amazon S3 added the default checksum, `CRC64NVME`, to the uploaded object). For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.

The Base64 encoded, 128-bit `MD5` digest of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `MD5` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumSHA1 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-Part-ChecksumSHA1"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 160-bit `SHA1` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the object was uploaded with the `SHA1` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumSHA512 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-Part-ChecksumSHA512"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 512-bit `SHA512` digest of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `SHA512` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumXXHASH128 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-Part-ChecksumXXHASH128"></a>
The Base64 encoded, 128-bit `XXHASH128` checksum of the part. This checksum is present if the multipart upload request was created with the `XXHASH128` checksum algorithm. For more information, see [Checking object integrity](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/checking-object-integrity.html) in the *Amazon S3 User Guide*.
Type: String
Required: No

 ** ChecksumXXHASH3 **   <a name="AmazonS3-Type-Part-ChecksumXXHASH3"></a>
