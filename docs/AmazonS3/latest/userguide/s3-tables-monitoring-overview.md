# Logging and monitoring for S3 Tables
<a name="s3-tables-monitoring-overview"></a>

Monitoring is an important part of maintaining the reliability, availability, and performance of Amazon S3 Tables. We recommend collecting monitoring data from your tables in table buckets so that you can more easily debug a multipoint failure if one occurs.

AWS provides several tools for monitoring your S3 Tables resources and responding to potential incidents.

**AWS CloudTrail Logs**
CloudTrail provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon S3. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon S3, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details. For more information, see [Logging Amazon S3 API calls using AWS CloudTrail](cloudtrail-logging.md).

**Amazon S3 Access Logs**
Server access logs provide detailed records about the requests that are made to a table bucket. When you enable server access logging on a table bucket, Amazon S3 delivers a log record for every request to that table bucket to a general purpose bucket that you specify. These logs are useful for security and access auditing. For more information, see [Logging requests for S3 Tables using server access logging](s3-tables-server-logs.md).

**Amazon CloudWatch Alarms**
Using Amazon CloudWatch alarms, you watch a single metric over a time period that you specify. If the metric exceeds a given threshold, a notification is sent to an Amazon SNS topic or AWS Auto Scaling policy. CloudWatch alarms do not invoke actions because they are in a particular state. Rather, the state must have changed and been maintained for a specified number of periods. For more information, see [Monitoring metrics with Amazon CloudWatch](cloudwatch-monitoring.md).
