# Supported operating systems and programming languages for Amazon Inspector
<a name="supported"></a>

 Amazon Inspector can scan software applications that are installed on the following:
+  Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances
**Note**
 For Amazon EC2 instances, Amazon Inspector can scan for package vulnerabilities in operating systems that support agent-based scanning. Amazon Inspector can also scan for package vulnerabilities in operating systems and programming languages that support hybrid scanning. Amazon Inspector does not scan for toolchain vulnerabilities. The version of the programming language compiler used to build the application introduces these vulnerabilities.
+  Machine images (AMIs) that your account owns
**Note**
 For machine images, Amazon Inspector can scan for operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities. For the operating systems that Amazon Inspector supports for machine image scanning, see [Supported operating systems: machine image scanning](#supported-os-ami). Amazon Inspector does not scan for toolchain vulnerabilities. The version of the programming language compiler used to build the application introduces these vulnerabilities.
+  Container images stored in Amazon Elastic Container Registry (Amazon ECR) repositories
**Note**
 For ECR container images, Amazon Inspector can scan for operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector also supports hardened images provided by Chainguard, Minimus, Echo, Docker, and Red Hat. Amazon Inspector does not scan for toolchain vulnerabilities in Rust——the version of the programming language compiler used to build the application introduces these vulnerabilities.
+  AWS Lambda functions
**Note**
 For Lambda functions, Amazon Inspector can scan for programming language package vulnerabilities and code vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector does not scan for toolchain vulnerabilities. The version of the programming language compiler used to build the application introduces these vulnerabilities.

 When Amazon Inspector scans resources, Amazon Inspector sources more than 50 data feeds to generate findings for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs). Examples of these sources include vendor security advisories, data feeds, and threat intelligence feeds, as well as the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) and MITRE. Amazon Inspector updates vulnerability data from source feeds at least once daily.

 For Amazon Inspector to scan a resource, the resource must be running a supported operating system or using a supported programming language. The topics in this section list the operating systems, programming languages, and runtimes Amazon Inspector supports for different resources and scan types. They also list discontinued operating systems.

**Note**
 Amazon Inspector can provide only limited support for an operating system after a vendor discontinues support for the operating system.

## Supported operating systems
<a name="supported-os"></a>

 This section lists the operating systems Amazon Inspector supports. Each table specifies the advisory source and advisory status for each operating system.

 The **Advisory status** column lists the vendor advisory statuses that Amazon Inspector uses to generate findings for an operating system. The column can contain the following values:

Fixed
 The vendor has released a fix for the vulnerability.

Open
 The vendor has acknowledged the vulnerability but hasn't released a fix.

Active
 The vendor is tracking the vulnerability, and a fix isn't available yet.

Pending
 The vendor is preparing a fix that hasn't been released yet.

 For some operating systems, the **Advisory source** includes additional repositories:

RHEL
 The advisory source includes the BaseOS repository and the EUS, E2S, and E4S repositories. For more information, see [Red Hat Enterprise Linux Life Cycle](https://access.redhat.com/support/policy/updates/errata) on the Red Hat website.

Ubuntu
 The advisory source includes Ubuntu Pro (esm-infra and esm-apps). For more information, see [Ubuntu Security Notices](https://ubuntu.com/security/notices) and [Expanded Security Maintenance](https://ubuntu.com/security/esm) on the Ubuntu website.

### Supported operating systems: Amazon EC2 scanning
<a name="supported-os-ec2"></a>

 The following table lists the operating systems Amazon Inspector supports for the scanning of Amazon EC2 instances. It specifies the advisory source and advisory status for each operating system and which operating systems support [agent-based scanning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/scanning-ec2.html#agent-based) and [agentless scanning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/scanning-ec2.html#agentless).

 When using the agent-based scanning method, you configure the SSM agent to perform continuous scans on all eligible instances. Amazon Inspector recommends that you configure a version of the SSM agent that's greater than 3.2.2086.0. For more information, see [Working with the SSM Agent](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/ssm-agent.html) in the *Amazon EC2 Systems Manager User Guide*.

 Linux operating system detections are supported only for the default package manager repository (rpm and dpkg). Detections don't include third-party applications, extended support repositories, or optional repositories (application streams) unless otherwise specified below. Amazon Inspector scans the running kernel for vulnerabilities. For some operating systems, like Ubuntu, a reboot is required for upgrades to show in active findings.

 For definitions of the advisory status values and details about advisory sources, see [Supported operating systems](#supported-os).

### Supported operating systems: machine image scanning
<a name="supported-os-ami"></a>

 The following table lists the operating systems Amazon Inspector supports for the scanning of machine images (AMIs). It specifies the advisory source and advisory status for each operating system.

 Machine image scanning doesn't use an agent. Amazon Inspector reads the software inventory directly from the Amazon EBS snapshots that back the image, so you don't need to install the SSM Agent or launch an instance from the image. For more information, see [Scanning machine images with Amazon Inspector](scanning-machine-images.md).

 Linux operating system detections are supported only for the default package manager repository (rpm and dpkg). Detections don't include third-party applications, extended support repositories, or optional repositories (application streams) unless otherwise specified below.

**Note**
 Amazon Inspector doesn't support machine image scanning for macOS. Amazon Inspector reports a scan status of `UNSUPPORTED_OS` for a machine image that runs an operating system that isn't listed in the following table, and for a machine image whose snapshots use a configuration that Amazon Inspector can't read, such as Logical Volume Manager (LVM).

 For definitions of the advisory status values and details about advisory sources, see [Supported operating systems](#supported-os).

## Discontinued operating systems
<a name="formerly-supported-os"></a>

 The following table lists operating systems that have been discontinued and when they were discontinued.

 Even though Amazon Inspector doesn't provide full support for discontinued operating systems, Amazon Inspector continues to scan Amazon EC2 instances and Amazon ECR container images running them. As a security best practice, Amazon Inspector generates a CRITICAL finding for resources using a discontinued operating system and recommends moving to a supported version. Findings that Amazon Inspector generates for discontinued operating systems should be used for informational purposes only.

 In accordance with vendor policy, discontinued operating systems no longer receive patch updates or security advisories. Vendors can also remove existing security advisories and detections from their feeds for operating systems that reach the end of standard support. As a result, Amazon Inspector stops generating findings for discontinued operating systems 12 months after the associated dates listed below.
