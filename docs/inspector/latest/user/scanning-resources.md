# Automated scan types in Amazon Inspector
<a name="scanning-resources"></a>

 Amazon Inspector uses a purpose-built scanning engine that monitors your resources for actionable software vulnerabilities and unintended network exposure. When Amazon Inspector detects a software vulnerability or unintended network exposure, it creates a [finding](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/findings-understanding.html). When you activate Amazon Inspector for the first time, your account is automatically enrolled in [all scan types](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/scanning-resources.html#scan-types), which include Amazon Amazon EC2 scanning, Amazon ECR Scanning, and Lambda standard scanning.

**Note**
 Lambda code scanning is an optional layer of Lambda function scanning that you can activate at any time.

**Note**
 Machine image scanning and Code Security for Amazon Inspector are optional scan types that you activate separately. Your account isn't automatically enrolled in them when you activate Amazon Inspector for the first time.

## Overview of Amazon Inspector scan types
<a name="scan-types"></a>

 Amazon Inspector provides different scan types, which focus on specific resource types in your AWS environment.

**Amazon EC2 scanning**
 When you activate Amazon EC2 scanning, Amazon Inspector scans your EC2 instances for common vulnerabilities and exposures (CVEs), network exposure issues, network reachability issues, operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector performs scans through the use of the SSM agent installed on your instance or through Amazon EBS snapshots of instances. For more information, see [Scanning Amazon EC2 instances with Amazon Inspector](scanning-ec2.md). By default, when you activate Amazon EC2 scanning, you automatically enable hybrid scanning mode. For more information, see [Agentless scanning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/scanning-ec2.html#agentless).

**Machine image scanning**
 When you activate machine image scanning, Amazon Inspector discovers the machine images (AMIs) that your account owns and scans them for operating system and programming language package vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector collects a software inventory from the Amazon EBS snapshots that back each machine image, so you don't need to launch an instance from an image for Amazon Inspector to scan it. By default, machine image scanning is continuous: Amazon Inspector scans new images as you create, copy, register, or enable them, and rescans in-scope images when new CVEs are published. You control which images are in scope with scan eligibility windows, a scan mode, and exclusion options. For more information, see [Scanning machine images with Amazon Inspector](scanning-machine-images.md).
 You can also scan a single machine image on demand, without activating Amazon Inspector. For more information, see [Running on-demand machine image scans with Amazon Inspector](machine-image-on-demand.md).
 Findings from on-demand machine image scans are an exception. Amazon Inspector delivers them only through Amazon EventBridge, so they don't appear in the Amazon Inspector console, aren't returned by `ListFindings`, and aren't sent to Security Hub CSPM. For more information, see [Running on-demand machine image scans with Amazon Inspector](machine-image-on-demand.md).

**Amazon ECR scanning**
 When you activate Amazon ECR scanning, Amazon Inspector converts all of the repositories in your private registry from basic scanning container repositories to enhanced scanning repositories. You can configure this setting with inclusion rules to scan on-push only or to scan select repositories. Amazon Inspector only scans ECR container images which are active (`imageStatus` field is `ACTIVE`) in ECR. Amazon Inspector scans all images pushed or transitioned to active (`lastActivatedAt`) in ECR within the last 30 days or pulled within the last 90 days. Amazon Inspector continues to monitor images for 90 days by default. You can change this setting at any time. For more information, see [Scanning Amazon Elastic Container Registry container images with Amazon Inspector](scanning-ecr.md).

**Lambda standard scanning**
 When you activate Lambda standard scanning, Amazon Inspector discovers all of the Lambda functions in your account and immediately scans them for vulnerabilities. Amazon Inspector scans new Lambda functions and layers when they're deployed. Amazon Inspector rescans them when they're updated or when new CVEs are published. For more information, scanning, see [Scanning AWS Lambda functions with Amazon Inspector](scanning-lambda.md).

**Lambda standard scanning \+ Lambda code scanning**
 When you activate Lambda code scanning, Amazon Inspector discovers the Lambda functions and layers in your account and scans them for code vulnerabilities. This type of scanning evaluates application package dependencies used in a Lambda function for CVEs. When you activate this scan type, you also activate Lambda standard scanning. For more information, see [Scanning AWS Lambda functions with Amazon Inspector](scanning-lambda.md).

**Code Security for Amazon Inspector**
 This scan type leverages the Amazon Q Developer scanning engine to scan first-party application code, third-party application dependencies, and Infrastructure as Code for vulnerabilities For more information, see [Code Security for Amazon Inspector](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/inspector/latest/user/code-security-assessments.html).
