# Viewing features using the AWS CLI
<a name="smart-crop-cli-view"></a>

To view information about Elemental Inference features, use `get-feed` to obtain this information:
+ The ARN of a feed.
+ The ARN of the MediaLive channel that is associated with the feed. This value is in `associatedResourceName`.
+ The data endpoint of the feed. The feed receives media data at this endpoint and returns the resulting metadata to this endpoint.
+ A list of the outputs that belong to the feed. Each output is of type `GetOutput`.
+ The status of each output is captured in each `GetOutput`. The output is either `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. MediaLive enables the cropping output that it uses for smart crop, and disables that output when no video output in the channel uses smart crop. MediaLive doesn't delete feed outputs.

  You can change the status of an output to disable the related feature. For information, see [Disabling some Elemental Inference features in a channel](smart-crop-disable-some.md) or [Disabling all Elemental Inference features in a channel](smart-crop-disable-all.md).
+ The status of the feed. You can't change the status of a feed. The service controls the status.

  The following statuses are most interesting when you are using MediaLive to work with Elemental Inference features:
  + `ACTIVE` means that the feed is associated with the channel.
  + `ARCHIVED` means that the feed is no longer associated with a channel. When you remove the feed from the channel or delete the channel, MediaLive disassociates the feed, and Elemental Inference sets its status to `ARCHIVED`. There is no way to change the status of a feed that is `ARCHIVED` or `DELETED`. To use Elemental Inference features in the channel again, create a new feed and add its ARN to the channel. The new feed has a new ID.
