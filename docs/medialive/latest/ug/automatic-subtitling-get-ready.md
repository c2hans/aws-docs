<a name="automatic-subtitling-get-ready"></a>

## Pricing
<a name="automatic-subtitling-pricing"></a>

There is a charge for running a channel that has the Smart Subtitles feature enabled. The charge is applied to each pipeline, which means that it applies once in single-pipeline channels and twice in standard channels.

To stop this charge, you must disable the feature. For information about the current rates for using this feature, see [Elemental Inference pricing](https://aws.amazon.com/elemental-inference/pricing/).

## Source requirements
<a name="automatic-subtitling-source-requirements"></a>
+ Input type: All supported input types.

## Output requirements
<a name="automatic-subtitling-output-requirements"></a>

Smart Subtitles generates subtitles in the following formats:
+ **TTML** – You can output TTML as sidecar captions in MediaPackage V2, CMAF Ingest, and Microsoft Smooth output groups.
+ **WebVTT** – You can output WebVTT as sidecar captions in HLS, MediaPackage, MediaPackage V2, and CMAF Ingest output groups.
+ **Burn-in** – You can burn the subtitles into the video in any output group that supports burn-in captions.

For the subtitle formats supported in each output group, see [Captions supported in MediaLive](supported-captions.md).

**Important**
When you output subtitles as TTML or WebVTT sidecar captions, you must create a separate captions-only output within your output group specifically for the subtitles. The subtitle output should contain only the captions encode, with no video or audio encodes. For detailed instructions on creating a sidecar captions output, see [Create sidecar or SMPTE-TT captions encodes](output-sidecar-and-smptett-mss.md).
When you burn in subtitles, add the captions description to the video output that should carry them, instead of creating a captions-only output.
