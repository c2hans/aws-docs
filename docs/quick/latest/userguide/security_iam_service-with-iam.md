Before you use IAM to manage access to AWS Quick, you should understand what IAM features are available to use with AWS Quick. To get a high-level view of how AWS Quick and other AWS services work with IAM, see [AWS Services That Work with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_aws-services-that-work-with-iam.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

## AWS Quick Policies (identity-based)
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies"></a>

With IAM identity-based policies, you can specify allowed or denied actions and resources as well as the conditions under which actions are allowed or denied. AWS Quick supports specific actions, resources, and condition keys. To learn about all of the elements that you use in a JSON policy, see [IAM JSON Policy Elements Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

You can use AWS root credentials or IAM user credentials to create an AWS Quick account. AWS root and administrator credentials already have all of the required permissions for managing AWS Quick access to AWS resources.

However, we recommend that you protect your root credentials, and instead use IAM user credentials. To do this, you can create a policy and attach it to the IAM user and roles that you plan to use for AWS Quick. The policy must include the appropriate statements for the AWS Quick administrative tasks you need to perform, as described in the following sections.

**Important**
Be aware of the following when working with Quick and IAM policies:
Avoid directly modifying a policy that was created by Quick. When you modify it yourself, Quick can't edit it. This inability can cause an issue with the policy. To fix this issue, delete the previously modified policy.
If you get an error on permissions when you try to create an AWS Quick account, see [Actions Defined by AWS Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonquicksight.html#amazonquicksight-actions-as-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide*.
In some cases, you might have an AWS Quick account that you can't access even from the root account (for example, if you accidentally deleted its directory service). In this case, you can delete your old AWS Quick account, then recreate it. For more information, see [Deleting your AWS Quick subscription and closing the account](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/closing-account.html).

### Actions
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-actions"></a>

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Action` element of a JSON policy describes the actions that you can use to allow or deny access in a policy. Include actions in a policy to grant permissions to perform the associated operation.

Policy actions in AWS Quick use the following prefix before the action: `quicksight:`. For example, to grant someone permission to run an Amazon EC2 instance with the Amazon EC2 `RunInstances` API operation, you include the `ec2:RunInstances` action in their policy. Policy statements must include either an `Action` or `NotAction` element. AWS Quick defines its own set of actions that describe tasks that you can perform with this service.

To specify multiple actions in a single statement, separate them with commas as follows:

```
"Action": [
	      "quicksight:action1",
	      "quicksight:action2"]
```

You can specify multiple actions using wildcards (\*). For example, to specify all actions that begin with the word `Create`, include the following action:

```
"Action": "quicksight:Create*"
```

AWS Quick provides a number of AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) actions. All AWS Quick actions are prefixed with `quicksight:`, such as `quicksight:Subscribe`. For information about using AWS Quick actions in an IAM policy, see [IAM policy examples for AWS Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html).

To see the most up-to-date list of AWS Quick actions, see [Actions Defined by AWS Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonquicksight.html#amazonquicksight-actions-as-permissions) in the *IAM User Guide*.

### Resources
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-resources"></a>

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Resource` JSON policy element specifies the object or objects to which the action applies. As a best practice, specify a resource using its [Amazon Resource Name (ARN)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference-arns.html). For actions that don't support resource-level permissions, use a wildcard (\*) to indicate that the statement applies to all resources.

```
"Resource": "*"
```

Following is an example policy. It means that the caller with this policy attached, is able to invoke the `CreateGroupMembership` operation on any group, provided that the user name they are adding to the group is not `user1`.

```
{
    "Effect": "Allow",
    "Action": "quicksight:CreateGroupMembership",
    "Resource": "arn:aws:quicksight:us-east-1:{{aws-account-id}}:group/default/*",
    "Condition": {
        "StringNotEquals": {
            "quicksight:UserName": "user1"
        }
    }
}
```

Some AWS Quick actions, such as those for creating resources, cannot be performed on a specific resource. In those cases, you must use the wildcard (\*).

```
"Resource": "*"
```

Some API actions involve multiple resources. To specify multiple resources in a single statement, separate the ARNs with commas.

```
"Resource": [
	      "resource1",
	      "resource2"
```

To see a list of AWS Quick resource types and their Amazon Resource Names (ARNs), see [Resources Defined by AWS Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonquicksight.html#amazonquicksight-resources-for-iam-policies) in the *IAM User Guide*. To learn with which actions you can specify the ARN of each resource, see [Actions Defined by AWS Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/service-authorization/latest/reference/list_amazonquicksight.html#amazonquicksight-actions-as-permissions).

### Condition keys
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-conditionkeys"></a>

Administrators can use AWS JSON policies to specify who has access to what. That is, which **principal** can perform **actions** on what **resources**, and under what **conditions**.

The `Condition` element specifies when statements execute based on defined criteria. You can create conditional expressions that use [condition operators](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_elements_condition_operators.html), such as equals or less than, to match the condition in the policy with values in the request. To see all AWS global condition keys, see [AWS global condition context keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

AWS Quick does not provide any service-specific condition keys, but it does support using some global condition keys. To see all AWS global condition keys, see [AWS Global Condition Context Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/reference_policies_condition-keys.html) in the *IAM User Guide*.

### Examples
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies-examples"></a>

To view examples of AWS Quick identity-based policies, see [AWS Quick Policies (identity-based)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam-id-based-policies.html).

## AWS Quick policies (resource-based)
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-resource-based-policies"></a>

AWS Quick doesn't support resource-based policies. However, you can use the AWS Quick console to configure access to other AWS resources in your AWS account.

## Authorization based on AWS Quick tags
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-tags"></a>

AWS Quick does not support tagging resources or controlling access based on tags.

## AWS Quick IAM roles
<a name="security_iam_service-with-iam-roles"></a>

An [IAM role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html) is an entity within your AWS account that has specific permissions. You can use IAM roles to group permissions together to make it easier to manage user's access to AWS Quick actions.

AWS Quick doesn't support the following role features:
+ Service-linked roles.
+ Service roles.
+ Temporary credentials (direct use): However, AWS Quick uses temporary credentials to allow users to assume an IAM role to access embedded dashboards. For more information, see [Embedded analytics for AWS Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedded-analytics.html).

For more information on how AWS Quick uses IAM roles, see [Using AWS Quick with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/security_iam_service-with-iam.html) and [IAM policy examples for AWS Quick](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/iam-policy-examples.html).
