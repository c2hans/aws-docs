# Embedding the AWS Quick Sight console using GetSessionEmbedUrl (old API)
<a name="embedded-analytics-full-console-for-authenticated-users-get"></a>

**Important**
AWS Quick Sight has new APIs for embedding analytics: `GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser` and `GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser`.
You can still use the `GetDashboardEmbedUrl` and `GetSessionEmbedUrl` APIs to embed dashboards and the AWS Quick Sight console, but they do not contain the latest embedding capabilities. For the latest up-to-date embedding experience, see [Embedding AWS Quick Sight analytics into your applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedding-overview.html).
