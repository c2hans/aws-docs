# Supported data types and values
<a name="supported-data-types-and-values"></a>

Amazon Quick Sight currently supports the following primitive data types: `Date`, `Decimal`, `Integer`, and `String`. The following data types are supported in SPICE: `Date`, `Decimal-fixed`, `Decimal-float`, `Integer`, and `String`. Quick Sight accepts Boolean values by promoting them to integers. It can also derive geospatial data types. Geospatial data types use metadata to interpret the physical data type. Latitude and longitude are numeric. All other geospatial categories are strings.

Make sure that any table or file that you use as a data source contains only fields that can be implicitly converted to these data types. Amazon Quick Sight skips any fields or columns that can't be converted. If you get an error that says "fields were skipped because they use unsupported data types", alter your query or table to remove or recast unsupported data types.

## String and text data
<a name="strings"></a>

Fields or columns that contain characters are called *strings*. A field with the data type of `STRING` can initially contain almost any type of data. Examples include names, descriptions, phone numbers, account numbers, JSON data, cities, post codes, dates, and numbers that can be used to calculate. These types are sometimes called textual data in a general sense, but not in a technical sense. Quick Sight doesn't support binary and character large objects (BLOBs) in dataset columns. In the Quick Sight documentation, the term "text" always means "string data".

The first time you query or import the data, Quick Sight tries to interpret the data that it identifies as other types, for example dates and numbers. It's a good idea to verify that the data types assigned to your fields or columns are correct.

For each string field in imported data, Quick Sight uses a field length of 8 bytes plus the UTF-8 encoded character length. Amazon Quick Sight supports UTF-8 file encoding, but not UTF-8 (with BOM).

## Date and time data
<a name="dates"></a>

Fields with a data type of `Date` also include time data, and are also known as `Datetime` fields. Quick Sight supports dates and times that use [supported date formats](#supported-date-formats).

Quick Sight uses UTC time for querying, filtering, and displaying date data. When date data doesn't specify a time zone, Quick Sight assumes UTC values. When date data does specify a time zone, Quick Sight converts it to display in UTC time. For example, a date field with a time zone offset like **2015-11-01T03:00:00-08:00** is converted to UTC and displayed in Amazon Quick Sight as **2015-11-01T15:30:00**.

For each `DATE` field in imported data, Quick Sight uses a field length of 8 bytes. Quick Sight supports UTF-8 file encoding, but not UTF-8 (with BOM).

## Numeric data
<a name="numeric"></a>

Numeric data includes integers and decimals. Integers with a data type of `INT` are negative or positive numbers that don't have a decimal place. Quick Sight doesn't distinguish between large and small integers. Integers over a value of `9007199254740991` or `2^53 - 1` might not display exactly or correctly in a visual.

Decimals with the data type of `Decimal` are negative or positive numbers that contain at least one decimal place before or after the decimal point. When you choose Direct Query mode, all non-integer decimal types are marked as `Decimal` and the underlying engine handles the precision of the datapoint based on the data source's supported behaviors. For more information on supported data source types, see [Supported data types and values](#supported-data-types-and-values).

When you store your dataset in SPICE, you can choose to store your decimal values as `fixed` or `float` decimal types. `Decimal-fixed` data types use the format of decimal (`18,4`) that allow 18 digits total and up to 4 digits after the decimal point. `Decimal-fixed` data types are a good choice to conduct exact mathematical operations, but Quick Sight rounds the value to the nearest ten thousandth place when the value is ingested into SPICE.

`Decimal-float` data types provide approximately 16 significant digits of accuracy to a value. The significant digits can be on either side of the decimal point to support numbers with many decimal places and higher numbers at the same time. For example, the `Decimal-float` data type supports the number `12345.1234567890` or the number `1234567890.12345`. If you work with very small numbers that are close to `0`, the `Decimal-float` data type supports up to 15 digits to the right of the decimal point, for example `0.123451234512345`. The maximum value that this data type supports is `1.8 * 10^308` to minimize the probability of an overflow error with your data set.

The `Decimal-float` data type is inexact and some values are stored as approximations instead of the real value. This may result in slight descrepencies when you store and return some specific values. The following considerations apply to the `Decimal-float` data type.
+ If the dataset that you're using comes from an Amazon S3 data source, SPICE assigns the `Decimal-float` decimal type to all numeric decimal values.
+ If the dataset that you're using comes from a database, SPICE uses the decimal type that the value is assigned in the database. For example, if the value is assigned a fixed-point numeric value in the database, the value will be a `Decimal-fixed` type in SPICE.

For existing SPICE datasets that contain fields that can be converted to the `Decimal-float` data type, a pop-up appears in the **Edit dataset** page. To convert fields of an existing dataset to the `Decimal-float` data type, choose **UPDATE FIELDS**. If you don't want to opt in, choose **DO NOT UPDATE FIELDS**. The **Update fields** pop up appears every time you open the **Edit dataset** page until the dataset is saved and published.

### Supported date formats
<a name="supported-date-formats"></a>

Amazon Quick Sight supports the date and time formats described in this section. Before you add data to Amazon Quick Sight, check if your date format is compatible. If you need to use an unsupported format, see [Using unsupported or custom dates](using-unsupported-dates.md).

The supported formats vary depending on the data source type, as follows:

| Data source | Clocks | Date formats |
| --- | --- | --- |
| File uploads<br />Amazon S3 sources<br />Athena<br />Salesforce | Both 24-hour and 12-hour clocks | Supported date and time formats are described in the Joda API documentation. <br />For a complete list of Joda date formats, see [Class DateTimeFormat](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/apidocs/org/joda/time/format/DateTimeFormat.html) on the Joda website.<br />For datasets stored in memory (SPICE), Amazon Quick Sight supports dates in the following range: `Jan 1, 0001 00:00:00 UTC` through `Dec 31, 9999, 23:59:59 UTC`.  |
| Relational databases sources | 24-hour clock only | The following data and time formats:[See the AWS documentation website for more details](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/quick/latest/userguide/supported-data-types-and-values.html) |

### Unsupported values in data
<a name="unsupported-data-values"></a>

If a field contains values that don't conform with the data type that Amazon Quick Sight assigns to the field, the rows containing those values are skipped. For example, take the following source data.

```
Sales ID    Sales Date    Sales Amount
--------------------------------------
001        10/14/2015        12.43
002        5/3/2012          25.00
003        Unknown           18.17
004        3/8/2009          86.02
```

Amazon Quick Sight interprets **Sales Date** as a date field and drops the row containing a nondate value, so only the following rows are imported.

```
Sales ID    Sales Date    Sales Amount
--------------------------------------
001        10/14/2015        12.43
002        5/3/2012          25.00
004        3/8/2009          86.02
```

In some cases, a database field might contain values that the JDBC driver can't interpret for the source database engine. In such cases, the uninterpretable values are replaced by null so that the rows can be imported. The only known occurrence of this issue is with MySQL date, datetime, and timestamp fields that have all-zero values, for example **0000-00-00 00:00:00**. For example, take the following source data.

```
Sales ID    Sales Date                Sales Amount
---------------------------------------------------
001        2004-10-12 09:14:27        12.43
002        2012-04-07 12:59:03        25.00
003        0000-00-00 00:00:00        18.17
004        2015-09-30 01:41:19        86.02
```

In this case, the following data is imported.

```
Sales ID    Sales Date                Sales Amount
---------------------------------------------------
001        2004-10-12 09:14:27        12.43
002        2012-04-07 12:59:03        25.00
003        (null)                     18.17
004        2015-09-30 01:41:19        86.02
```
