# Incident response, logging, and monitoring in Amazon Quick Sight using CloudTrail
<a name="incident-response-logging-and-monitoring-qs"></a>

Amazon Quick Sight is integrated with AWS CloudTrail. This service provides a record of actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service in Amazon Quick Sight. CloudTrail captures all API calls for Amazon Quick Sight as events. The calls captured include some calls from the Amazon Quick Sight console and all code calls to Amazon Quick Sight API operations. If you create a trail, you can enable continuous delivery of CloudTrail events to an Amazon S3 bucket, including events for Amazon Quick Sight. If you don't configure a trail, you can still view the most recent events in the CloudTrail console in **Event history**. Using the information collected by CloudTrail, you can determine the request that was made to Amazon Quick Sight, the IP address from which the request was made, who made the request, when it was made, and additional details.

Amazon Quick Sight doesn’t natively support alerting with Amazon CloudWatch or other external systems. However, it's possible to develop a custom solution to process CloudTrail logs.

Amazon Quick Sight service status can be viewed on the [Service Health Dashboard](https://status.aws.amazon.com/).

By default, the log files delivered by CloudTrail to your bucket are encrypted by Amazon [server-side encryption with Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html). To provide a security layer that is directly manageable, you can instead use [server-side encryption with AWS KMS–managed keys (SSE-KMS)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingKMSEncryption.html) for your CloudTrail log files. Enabling server-side encryption encrypts the log files but not the digest files with SSE-KMS. Digest files are encrypted with [Amazon S3-managed encryption keys (SSE-S3)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingServerSideEncryption.html).

To learn more about CloudTrail, including how to configure and enable it, see the [AWS CloudTrail User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/).

CloudTrail is enabled on your AWS account when you create the account. When supported event activity occurs in Amazon Quick Sight, that activity is recorded in a CloudTrail event along with other AWS service events in **Event history**. You can view, search, and download recent events in your AWS account. For more information, see [Viewing Events with CloudTrail Event History](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/view-cloudtrail-events.html).

For an ongoing record of events in your AWS account, including events for Amazon Quick Sight, create a trail. A *trail* enables CloudTrail to deliver log files to an Amazon S3 bucket. By default, when you create a trail in the console, the trail applies to all . The trail logs events from all Regions in the AWS partition and delivers the log files to the Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. Additionally, you can configure other AWS services to further analyze and act upon the event data collected in CloudTrail logs. For more information, see the following:

+ [Cross-Account CloudTrail Logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lake-formation/latest/dg/cross-account-logging.html) in the AWS Lake Formation Developer Guide Guide – This topic includes instructions for including principal identities in cross-account CloudTrail logs.

Amazon Quick Sight supports logging the following actions as events in CloudTrail log files:
+ Whether the request was made with root or AWS Identity and Access Management user credentials
+ Whether the request was made with temporary security credentials for an IAM role or federated user
+ Whether the request was made by another AWS service

For more information on user identity, see the [CloudTrail userIdentity Element](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-event-reference-user-identity.html).

By default, each Amazon Quick Sight log entry contains the following information:
+  **userIdentity** – User identity

+  **eventTime** – Event time

+  **eventId** – Event Id

+  **readOnly** – Read only

+  **awsRegion** – AWS Region

+  **eventSource (quicksight)** – Source of the event (Amazon Quick Sight)

+  **eventType (AwsServiceEvent)** – Event type (AWS service event)

+  **recipientAccountId (customer AWS account)** – Recipient account ID (Customer AWS account)

**Note**
 CloudTrail displays users as `unknown` if they were provisioned by Amazon Quick Sight. This display is because these users aren't a known IAM identity type.

## Example: Amazon Quick Sight log file entries
<a name="understanding-quicksight-entries"></a>

 A trail is a configuration that enables delivery of events as log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you specify. CloudTrail log files contain one or more log entries. An event represents a single request from any source and includes information about the requested action, the date and time of the action, request parameters, and so on. CloudTrail log files aren't an ordered stack trace of the public API calls, so they don't appear in any specific order.

The following example shows a CloudTrail log entry that demonstrates the BatchCreateUser action.

```
{
   "eventVersion":"1.05",
   "userIdentity":
	{
	   "type":"Root",
	   "principalId":"123456789012",
	   "arn":"arn:aws:iam::123456789012:root",
	   "accountId":"123456789012",
	   "userName":"test-username"
	},
	   "eventTime":"2017-04-19T03:16:13Z",
	   "eventSource":"quicksight.amazonaws.com",
	   "eventName":"BatchCreateUser",
	   "awsRegion":"us-west-2",
	   "requestParameters":null,
	   "responseElements":null,
	   "eventID":"e7d2382e-70a0-3fb7-9d41-a7a913422240",
	   "readOnly":false,
	   "eventType":"AwsServiceEvent",
	   "recipientAccountId":"123456789012",
	   "serviceEventDetails":
	   {
		   "eventRequestDetails":
		   {
				"users":
				{
					"test-user-11":
					{
						"role":"USER"
					},
					"test-user-22":
					{
						"role":"ADMIN"
					}
				}
			},
			"eventResponseDetails":
			{
			"validUsers":[
				],
			"InvalidUsers":[
				"test-user-11",
				"test-user-22"
				]
			}
	   }
   }
```
