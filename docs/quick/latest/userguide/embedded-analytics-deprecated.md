|    Intended audience:  AWS Quick developers  |

The following API operations for embedding AWS Quick Sight dashboards and the AWS Quick Sight console have been replaced by the GenerateEmbedUrlForAnonymousUser and GenerateEmbedUrlForRegisteredUser API operations. You can still use them to embed analytics in your application, but they are no longer maintained and do not contain the latest embedding features or functionality. For the latest up-to-date embedding experience, see [Embedding AWS Quick Sight analytics into your applications](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/user/embedding-overview.html)
+ The [GetDashboardEmbedUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_GetDashboardEmbedUrl.html) API operation embeds interactive dashboards.
+ The [GetSessionEmbedUrl](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/quicksight/latest/APIReference/API_GetSessionEmbedUrl.html) API operation embeds the AWS Quick Sight console.
