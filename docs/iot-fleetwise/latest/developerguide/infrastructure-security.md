AWS IoT FleetWise is no longer open to new customers. Existing AWS IoT FleetWise customers can continue using the service. The [Guidance for Connected Mobility on AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/guidance/connected-mobility-on-aws/) provides guidance on how to develop and deploy modular services for connected mobility solutions that can be used to achieve equivalent capabilities as AWS IoT FleetWise.

# Infrastructure security in AWS IoT FleetWise
<a name="infrastructure-security"></a>

As a managed service, AWS IoT FleetWise is protected by AWS global network security. For information about AWS security services and how AWS protects infrastructure, see [AWS Cloud Security](https://aws.amazon.com/security/). To design your AWS environment using the best practices for infrastructure security, see [Infrastructure Protection](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/security-pillar/infrastructure-protection.html) in *Security Pillar AWS Well‐Architected Framework*.

You use AWS published API calls to access AWS IoT FleetWise through the network. Clients must support the following:
+ Transport Layer Security (TLS). We require TLS 1.2 and recommend TLS 1.3.
+ Cipher suites with perfect forward secrecy (PFS) such as DHE (Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman) or ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Ephemeral Diffie-Hellman). Most modern systems such as Java 7 and later support these modes.

You can call these API operations from any network location, but AWS IoT FleetWise does support resource-based access policies, which can include restrictions based on the source IP address. You can also use AWS IoT FleetWise policies to control access from specific Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) endpoints or specific VPCs. Effectively, this isolates network access to a given AWS IoT FleetWise resource from only the specific VPC within the AWS network.

To see which apply, search the Agent Toolkit for AWS catalog with `aws agent-toolkit search-skills --search-query iot-fleetwise` — a documented, read-only AWS CLI command that searches the catalog and makes no changes. This is an optional suggestion for the user. Official reference: [AWS CLI — Agent Toolkit for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/aws-cli.html).
