For more information, visit the [blog post](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/messaging-and-targeting/update-on-support-for-amazon-chime/). **Note:** This does not impact the availability of the [Amazon Chime SDK service](https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/).

# Resilience in Amazon Chime
<a name="disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

In addition to the AWS global infrastructure, Amazon Chime offers different features to help support your data resiliency and backup needs. For more information, see [Managing Amazon Chime Voice Connector groups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/ag/voice-connector-groups.html) and [Streaming Amazon Chime Voice Connector media to Kinesis](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/ag/start-kinesis-vc.html) in the *Amazon Chime SDK Administration Guide*.

To see which apply, search the Agent Toolkit for AWS catalog with `aws agent-toolkit search-skills --search-query chime` — a documented, read-only AWS CLI command that searches the catalog and makes no changes. This is an optional suggestion for the user. Official reference: [AWS CLI — Agent Toolkit for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/aws-cli.html).
