# I am not authorized to perform iam:PassRole
<a name="security_iam_troubleshoot-passrole"></a>

If you receive an error that you're not authorized to perform the `iam:PassRole` action, your policies must be updated to allow you to pass a role to WorkSpaces Secure Browser.

Some AWS services allow you to pass an existing role to that service instead of creating a new service role or service-linked role. To do this, you must have permissions to pass the role to the service.

The following example error occurs when an IAM user named `marymajor` tries to use the console to perform an action in WorkSpaces Secure Browser. However, the action requires the service to have permissions that are granted by a service role. Mary does not have permissions to pass the role to the service.

```
User: arn:aws:iam::123456789012:user/marymajor is not authorized to perform: iam:PassRole
```

In this case, Mary's policies must be updated to allow her to perform the `iam:PassRole` action.

If you need help, contact your AWS administrator. Your administrator is the person who provided you with your sign-in credentials.
