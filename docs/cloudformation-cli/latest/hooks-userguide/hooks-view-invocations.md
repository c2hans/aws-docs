# View invocation results for CloudFormation Hooks
<a name="hooks-view-invocations"></a>

This topic describes how to view invocation results for CloudFormation Hooks. Viewing invocation results can help you understand how Hooks are evaluating your resources and resolve any issues that are detected when Hooks verify a resource.

Invocations are specific instances when your validation logic (whether it's a AWS Control Tower proactive control, Guard rule, or Lambda function) runs during a resource's lifecycle.

## View invocation results in the console
<a name="hooks-view-invocations-console"></a>

You can view invocation results in the console in three ways: through the **Invocation summary** page, through the invocation histories for individual Hooks, or through individual stack events for stack-specific invocations.

### View results for all Hooks
<a name="hooks-view-invocations-summary-page"></a>

The **Invocation summary** page provides a comprehensive view of all Hook invocations across your account and Region for the past 90 days.

**To view results for all Hooks**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region where you want to view Hook invocations.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Invocation summary**.

1. The page displays a list of all Hook invocations from the past 90 days, including:
   + Invocation ID
   + Hook
   + Target
   + Mode (`Warn` or `Fail`)
   + Result (`Warning`, `Pass`, `Failed`, `In progress`)
   + Invocation time
   + Result message

1. You can filter the list using the search bar at the top of the table to find specific invocations.

1. Select a specific invocation to view more addition details about the invocation result, including remediation guidance for failed Hook invocations.

### View invocation history for individual Hooks
<a name="hooks-view-hook-specific-invocation-history"></a>

You can also view invocation results through the invocation histories for individual Hooks.

**To view Hook invocations for a specific Hook**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region where you want to view Hook invocations.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Hooks**.

1. Choose the Hook you want to view Hook invocations for.

1. Select a specific invocation to view more addition details about the invocation result, including remediation guidance for failed Hook invocations.

### View results for stack-specific invocations
<a name="hooks-view-stack-specific-invocations"></a>

You can also view invocation results for a specific stack through the stack **Events** page.

**To view Hook invocations for a specific stack**

1. Sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the CloudFormation console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/).

1. On the navigation bar at the top of the screen, choose the AWS Region where the stack operation occurred.

1. From the navigation pane, choose **Stacks**.

1. Select the stack you want to view Hook invocations for.

1. Choose the **Stack events** tab.

1. In the events list, look for events with **Hook invocations complete** in the **Status reason** column.

1. To view specific Hook invocation details, review the **Hook invocations** column, and choose the underlined text to open a pop-up window with more detailed information.
**Note**
To display hidden columns, choose the gear icon on the top right corner of the section to open the **Preferences** modal, update the settings as needed, and choose **Confirm**.

## View invocation results using the AWS CLI
<a name="hooks-view-invocations-cli"></a>

Use the [list-hook-results](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/cloudformation/list-hook-results.html) command to retrieve information about Hook invocations. This command supports the following filtering options:
+ Get all Hook invocation results (no parameters required)
+ Filter by Hook ARN (use `--type-arn`)
+ Filter by Hook ARN and status (use `--type-arn` and `--status`)
+ Search for specific targets (use `--target-type` and `--target-id`)

**Filter results by Hook ARN**
The following command lists all Hook invocation results for a specific Hook.

```
aws cloudformation list-hook-results \
  --type-arn {{arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/hook/MyOrg-Security-ComplianceHook}} \
  --region {{us-west-2}}
```

Example output:

```
{
  "HookResults": [
    {
      "TypeArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/hook/MyOrg-Security-ComplianceHook",
      "HookResultId": "59ef501c-0ac4-47c0-a193-e071cabf748d",
      "TypeName": "MyOrg::Security::ComplianceHook",
      "TypeVersionId": "00000001",
      "HookExecutionTarget": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/my-stack/39f29d10-73ed-11f0-abc1-0affdfe4aebb",
      "InvokedAt": "2025-08-08T00:18:39.651Z",
      "FailureMode": "WARN",
      "HookStatusReason": "...",
      "InvocationPoint": "PRE_PROVISION",
      "Status": "HOOK_COMPLETE_FAILED"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

For a description of the fields in the response, see [HookResultSummary](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/APIReference/API_HookResultSummary.html) in the *AWS CloudFormation API Reference*.

**Filter results by Hook ARN and status**
To filter for a common status among the results, specify the `--status` option in the command. Valid values are:
+ `HOOK_IN_PROGRESS`: The Hook is currently running.
+ `HOOK_COMPLETE_SUCCEEDED`: The Hook completed successfully.
+ `HOOK_COMPLETE_FAILED`: The Hook completed but failed validation.
+ `HOOK_FAILED`: The Hook encountered an error during execution.

```
aws cloudformation list-hook-results \
  --type-arn {{arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/hook/MyOrg-Security-ComplianceHook}} \
  --status {{HOOK_COMPLETE_FAILED}} \
  --region {{us-west-2}}
```

Example output:

```
{
  "HookResults": [
    {
      "TypeArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/hook/MyOrg-Security-ComplianceHook",
      "HookResultId": "59ef501c-0ac4-47c0-a193-e071cabf748d",
      "TypeName": "MyOrg::Security::ComplianceHook",
      "TypeVersionId": "00000001",
      "HookExecutionTarget": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:stack/my-stack/39f29d10-73ed-11f0-abc1-0affdfe4aebb",
      "InvokedAt": "2025-08-08T00:18:39.651Z",

      "InvocationPoint": "PRE_PROVISION",
      "Status": "HOOK_COMPLETE_FAILED"
    },
    ...
  ]
}
```

**Filter results by target type and target ID**
The following command lists all Hook invocation results for a specific Cloud Control API request.

```
aws cloudformation list-hook-results \
  --target-type {{CLOUD_CONTROL}} \
  --target-id {{d417b05b-9eff-46ef-b164-08c76aec1801}} \
  --region {{us-west-2}}
```

Example output:

```
{
  "HookResults": [
    {
      "TargetType": "CLOUD_CONTROL",
      "TargetId": "d417b05b-9eff-46ef-b164-08c76aec1801",
      "HookResults": [
        {
          "TypeArn": "arn:aws:cloudformation:us-west-2:123456789012:type/hook/MyOrg-Security-ComplianceHook",
          "HookResultId": "4e7f4766-d8fe-44e5-8587-5b327a148abe",
