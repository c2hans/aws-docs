# ProductAttributeValues
<a name="API_ProductAttributeValues"></a>

The product attribute values that you can use to filter the costs of supported services. Currently, Amazon Bedrock is the only supported service.

The following product attribute keys are available for each supported service:
+ Amazon Bedrock
  +  `provider` - The model provider, such as `Anthropic`, `Cohere`, or `OpenAI`.
  +  `model` - The model, such as `Claude Sonnet 5` or `Claude Haiku 4.5`.
  +  `inferenceType` - The type of inference usage, such as `Input tokens` or `Output tokens`.
  +  `feature` - The feature that was used, such as `On-demand Inference` or `Reranker`.

The following operations support product attributes: `GetCostAndUsage`, `GetCostAndUsageWithResources`, `GetDimensionValues` (in the `COST_AND_USAGE` context), `GetTags`, and `GetCostCategories`.

Product attribute data is available for time periods that start on or after September 1, 2026. Requests for earlier time periods that use product attributes fail with a `DataUnavailableException`.

The `SERVICE` filter rules for product attributes depend on the operation:
+  `GetCostAndUsage` and `GetCostAndUsageWithResources` - Optional.
+  `GetDimensionValues` - Required when the filter includes `ProductAttributes`, for any `Dimension`. Otherwise, optional.
+  `GetTags` and `GetCostCategories` - Required when the filter includes `ProductAttributes`.

A `SERVICE` filter must contain only supported services, or the request fails with a `ValidationException`. Service names are matched exactly. To list them, use `GetDimensionValues` with `Dimension` set to `SERVICE` and the same `TimePeriod`, for example with `SearchString` set to `Bedrock`.

The costs of a supported service can appear under multiple service names. When the `SERVICE` filter is optional, omit it so that your results include all of those costs.

For example, the following `Expression` filters for the costs of one model: `{ "ProductAttributes": { "Key": "model", "Values": [ "Claude Sonnet 5" ], "MatchOptions": [ "EQUALS" ] } }`

## Contents
<a name="API_ProductAttributeValues_Contents"></a>

 ** Key **   <a name="awscostmanagement-Type-ProductAttributeValues-Key"></a>
The name of the product attribute, such as `model`. The keys that are available depend on the service. For the keys of each supported service, see [`ProductAttributeValues`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-cost-management/latest/APIReference/API_ProductAttributeValues.html).
Keys are case-sensitive. A key that doesn't exist doesn't return an error: `EQUALS` matches no costs, and `ABSENT` matches all costs of supported services.
Type: String
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 1024.
Pattern: `^([a-zA-Z][a-zA-Z0-9]*)?$`
Required: Yes

 ** MatchOptions **   <a name="awscostmanagement-Type-ProductAttributeValues-MatchOptions"></a>
The match options that you can use to filter your results. Valid values:
+  `EQUALS` - Matches the values that you specify.
+  `ABSENT` - Matches costs that have no value for the key. Omit `Values`.
+  `CASE_SENSITIVE` - Use only with `EQUALS`. Values are always matched case-sensitively.
Default values are `EQUALS` and `CASE_SENSITIVE`.
Type: Array of strings
Valid Values: `EQUALS | ABSENT | STARTS_WITH | ENDS_WITH | CONTAINS | CASE_SENSITIVE | CASE_INSENSITIVE | GREATER_THAN_OR_EQUAL`
Required: No

 ** Values **   <a name="awscostmanagement-Type-ProductAttributeValues-Values"></a>
The specific values of the product attribute, such as `Claude Sonnet 5` for the `model` key. Values are matched exactly, including case. To list the values of a key, use `GetDimensionValues` with `Dimension` set to `PRODUCT_ATTRIBUTE` and `DimensionKey` set to the key.
To match costs that have no value for the key, set `MatchOptions` to `ABSENT` and omit `Values`. Otherwise, `Values` is required.
Type: Array of strings
Array Members: Minimum number of 1 item. Maximum number of 6000 items.
Length Constraints: Minimum length of 0. Maximum length of 1024.
Pattern: `[\S\s]*`
Required: No
