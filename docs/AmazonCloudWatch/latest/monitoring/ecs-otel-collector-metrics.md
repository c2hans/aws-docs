# Metrics and attributes
<a name="ecs-otel-collector-metrics"></a>

For each running task, the receiver emits about 28 task-level metrics (`ecs.task.*`). It also emits about 26 container-level metrics (`container.*`) for each running container. The following table lists commonly used metrics.

| Metric | Unit | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ecs.task.cpu.utilized, ecs.task.cpu.reserved | CPU units (1024 = 1 vCPU) | Task CPU used and reserved |
| ecs.task.memory.utilized, ecs.task.memory.reserved | MiB | Task memory used and reserved |
| ecs.task.network.rate.rx, ecs.task.network.rate.tx | Bytes/second | Task network throughput |
| ecs.task.storage.read\_bytes, ecs.task.storage.write\_bytes | Bytes, cumulative | Task storage I/O. Use rate() in queries. |
| container.cpu.utilized, container.cpu.reserved | CPU units | Container CPU used and reserved |
| container.memory.utilized, container.memory.reserved | MiB | Container memory used and reserved |
| container.memory.usage, container.memory.usage.limit | Bytes | Container memory usage and hard limit |
| container.network.rate.rx, container.network.rate.tx | Bytes/second | Network throughput of the container's network interface |

In PromQL, resource attributes appear with the `@resource.` prefix. With the configuration in step 2, each series has the following attributes.

| Attribute | Present on |
| --- | --- |
| aws.ecs.cluster.name | Task and container metrics |
| aws.ecs.service.name | Task and container metrics. Empty for tasks that aren't part of a service. |
| aws.ecs.task.family, aws.ecs.task.revision | Task and container metrics |
| aws.ecs.task.id | Task and container metrics |
| aws.ecs.task.launch\_type | Task and container metrics. The value is EC2, FARGATE, or MANAGED\_INSTANCES. |
| aws.ecs.launchtype | Task and container metrics. The value is ec2 or fargate. Not set for Amazon ECS Managed Instances. |
| cloud.availability\_zone | Task and container metrics |
| container.name, container.image.name, container.image.tag | Container metrics |
