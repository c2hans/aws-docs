# Use `DeleteSyslogConfiguration` with an AWS SDK
<a name="example_cloudwatch-logs_DeleteSyslogConfiguration_section"></a>

The following code example shows how to use `DeleteSyslogConfiguration`.

Action examples are code excerpts from larger programs and must be run in context. You can see this action in context in the following code example:
