# Hello CloudWatch Logs
<a name="example_cloudwatch-logs_Hello_section"></a>

The following code example shows how to get started using CloudWatch Logs.

------
#### [ Python ]

**SDK for Python (Boto3)**
 There's more on GitHub. Find the complete example and learn how to set up and run in the [AWS Code Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/python/example_code/cloudwatch-logs/scenarios/syslog_ingestion#code-examples).

```
def hello_cloudwatch_logs() -> None:
    """
    Verifies connectivity to CloudWatch Logs by calling DescribeLogGroups
    and displaying the first page of log groups with name, ARN, and
    creation time.
    """
    logs_client = boto3.client("logs")

    try:
        response = logs_client.describe_log_groups()
        log_groups = response.get("logGroups", list())

        if not log_groups:
            print("No log groups found in this Region for your account.")
        else:
            print(f"Found {len(log_groups)} log group(s):\n")
            for lg in log_groups:
                name = lg.get("logGroupName", "N/A")

                creation_ms = lg.get("creationTime", 0)
                creation_dt = datetime.fromtimestamp(
                    creation_ms / 1000, tz=timezone.utc
                )

                print(f"  Created: {creation_dt.strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S UTC')}")
                print()

    except ClientError as error:
        logger.error(
            "Failed to describe log groups: %s",
            error.response["Error"]["Message"],
        )
