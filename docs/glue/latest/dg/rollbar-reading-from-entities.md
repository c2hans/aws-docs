A Rollbar object you want to read from. For the available entities, see the following supported entities table.

**Supported entities for source**

| Entity | Can be filtered | Supports limit | Supports select \* | Supports order by | Supports partitioning |

**Example – Reading from a Rollbar entity**
The following example reads from the `deploys` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Rollbar connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="rollbar",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "deploys"
    }
)
```
