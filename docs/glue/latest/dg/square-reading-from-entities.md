# Reading from Square entities
<a name="square-reading-from-entities"></a>

**Prerequisites**

A Square object you want to read from. For the available entities, see the following supported entities table.

The `locations-transactions` entity belongs to a location. Set `ENTITY_NAME` to the full entity path that AWS Glue returns when it lists the entities for your connection, for example `locations-transactions/{{locationId}}`. All other entities are top-level entities.

**Example – Reading from a Square entity**
The following example reads from the `bank-accounts` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Square connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="square",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "bank-accounts"
    }
)
```
