**Example – Reading from a Zoho Invoice entity**
The following example reads from the `contact_addresses` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Zoho Invoice connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="zohoinvoice",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "contact_addresses"
    }
)
```
