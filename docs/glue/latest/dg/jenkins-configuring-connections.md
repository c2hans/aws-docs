# Configuring Jenkins connections
<a name="jenkins-configuring-connections"></a>

Jenkins connections use basic authentication. You store the credential in Secrets Manager and reference that secret when you create the connection in AWS Glue Studio.

To configure a Jenkins connection:

1. Obtain your Jenkins API credential (see the Jenkins API documentation on the Jenkins website).

1. In Secrets Manager, create a secret containing your Jenkins credential with the keys `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`. The key names must be in uppercase exactly as shown.

1. In the AWS Glue Studio console, choose **Connections** under **Data Catalog**, then choose **Create connection**.

1. Search for and choose Jenkins as the data source.

1. For credentials, choose the Secrets Manager secret you created, select the IAM role that AWS Glue can assume to read the secret, optionally set network options, and complete the connection creation.

1. Grant the IAM role associated with your AWS Glue job permission to read the secret.
