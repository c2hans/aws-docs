# Configuring Chargebee connections
<a name="chargebee-configuring-connections"></a>

Chargebee connections use basic authentication. You store the credential in Secrets Manager and reference that secret when you create the connection in AWS Glue Studio.

To configure a Chargebee connection:

1. Obtain your Chargebee API credential (see the Chargebee API documentation on the Chargebee website).

1. In Secrets Manager, create a secret with the key `USERNAME` set to your Chargebee API key. The `PASSWORD` key is not required.

1. In the AWS Glue Studio console, choose **Connections** under **Data Catalog**, then choose **Create connection**.

1. Search for and choose Chargebee as the data source.

1. For credentials, choose the Secrets Manager secret you created, select the IAM role that AWS Glue can assume to read the secret, optionally set network options, and complete the connection creation.

1. Grant the IAM role associated with your AWS Glue job permission to read the secret.
