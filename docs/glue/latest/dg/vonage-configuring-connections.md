# Configuring Vonage connections
<a name="vonage-configuring-connections"></a>

Vonage connections use basic authentication. You store the credential in Secrets Manager and reference that secret when you create the connection in AWS Glue Studio.

To configure a Vonage connection:

1. Obtain your Vonage API credential (see the Vonage API documentation on the Vonage website).

1. In Secrets Manager, create a secret containing your Vonage credential with the keys `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD`. The key names must be in uppercase exactly as shown.

1. In the AWS Glue Studio console, choose **Connections** under **Data Catalog**, then choose **Create connection**.

1. Search for and choose Vonage as the data source.

1. For credentials, choose the Secrets Manager secret you created, select the IAM role that AWS Glue can assume to read the secret, optionally set network options, and complete the connection creation.

1. Grant the IAM role associated with your AWS Glue job permission to read the secret.
