# Reading from Klaviyo entities
<a name="klaviyo-reading-from-entities"></a>

**Prerequisites**

A Klaviyo object you want to read from. See the supported entities table below for the available entities.

**Supported entities for source**

| Entity | Can be filtered | Supports limit | Supports select \* | Supports order by | Supports partitioning |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| campaigns | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| events | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | Yes |
| lists | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| metrics | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| profiles | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| segments | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |

**Example – Reading from a Klaviyo entity**
The following example reads from the `campaigns` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Klaviyo connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="klaviyo",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "campaigns"
    }
)
```

**Partitioning queries**

You can provide the additional Spark options `PARTITION_FIELD`, `LOWER_BOUND`, `UPPER_BOUND`, and `NUM_PARTITIONS` to read in parallel. The query is split into `NUM_PARTITIONS` sub-queries that Spark runs concurrently. The following entities and fields support partitioning:

| Entity | Partitioning field |
| --- | --- |
| events | datetime |
