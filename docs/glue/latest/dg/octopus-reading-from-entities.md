<a name="octopus-reading-from-entities"></a>

**Prerequisites**

An Octopus Deploy object you want to read from. For the available entities, see the following supported entities table.

| teams | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |
| tenants | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |

| worker-pools | No | Yes | Yes | No | No |

**Space-scoped and project-scoped entities**
Most Octopus Deploy entities belong to a space, and some belong to a project in a space. For these entities, include the space ID, and the project ID when required, in `ENTITY_NAME`, separated by `/`. AWS Glue discovers the available spaces and projects when you browse entities. The following table lists the `ENTITY_NAME` format for each scope.

| Scope | `ENTITY_NAME` format | Entities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Instance | {{entity}} | actiontemplates-categories, communityactiontemplates, events, events-agents, events-categories, events-documenttypes, events-groups, spaces, tasks-tasktypes, teams, users |
| Space | {{entity}}/{{spaceId}}, for example deployments/Spaces-1 | artifacts, channels, deploymentprocesses, deployments, environments, feeds, interruptions, libraryvariablesets, lifecycles, machinepolicies, machines, project-groups, projects, releases, tagsets, tasks, tenants, worker-pools |
| Project | {{entity}}/{{spaceId}}/{{projectId}}, for example runbooks/Spaces-1/Projects-1 | projecttriggers, runbookprocesses, runbookruns, runbooks, runbooksnapshots |

**Example – Reading from an Octopus Deploy entity**
The following example reads from the `actiontemplates-categories` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Octopus Deploy connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="octopus",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "actiontemplates-categories"
    }
)
```
