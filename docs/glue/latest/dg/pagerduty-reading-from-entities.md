# Reading from PagerDuty entities
<a name="pagerduty-reading-from-entities"></a>

**Prerequisites**

A PagerDuty object you want to read from. See the supported entities table below for the available entities.

The `alerts` and `incident_notes` entities belong to an incident, and `team_members` belongs to a team. Use `alerts/{{incidentId}}`, `incident_notes/{{incidentId}}`, or `team_members/{{teamId}}`. AWS Glue discovers the available incident and team IDs for your connection.

**Supported entities for source**

**Example – Reading from a PagerDuty entity**
The following example reads from the `incidents` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your PagerDuty connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="pagerduty",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "incidents"
    }
)
```
