# Reading from Fivetran entities
<a name="fivetran-reading-from-entities"></a>

**Prerequisites**

A Fivetran object you want to read from. For the available entities, see the following supported entities table.

The `group-users` entity belongs to a group. The `team-groups` and `team-users` entities belong to a team. For a nested entity, set `ENTITY_NAME` to the full entity path that AWS Glue returns when it lists the entities for your connection, for example `group-users/{{groupId}}`. All other entities are top-level entities.

**Example – Reading from a Fivetran entity**
The following example reads from the `connections` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Fivetran connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="fivetran",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "connections"
    }
)
```
