**Example – Reading from a ClickUp entity**
The following Python example reads the `groups` entity of one workspace. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your ClickUp connection and {{teamId}} with the workspace (team) ID:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="clickup",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "groups/{{teamId}}"
    }
)
```
