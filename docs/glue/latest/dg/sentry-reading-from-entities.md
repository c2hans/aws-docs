# Reading from Sentry entities
<a name="sentry-reading-from-entities"></a>

**Prerequisites**

A Sentry object you want to read from. For the available entities, see the following supported entities table.

The `organizations` entity is a top-level entity. All other Sentry entities belong to an organization. For these entities, set `ENTITY_NAME` to the full entity path that AWS Glue returns when it lists the entities for your connection, for example `projects/{{organizationSlug}}`.

**Example – Reading from a Sentry entity**
The following example reads from the `organizations` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Sentry connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="sentry",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "organizations"
    }
)
```
