A Contentful object you want to read from. For the available entities, see the following supported entities table.

**Example – Reading from a Contentful entity**
The following example reads from the `assets` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Contentful connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="contentful",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "assets"
    }
)
```
