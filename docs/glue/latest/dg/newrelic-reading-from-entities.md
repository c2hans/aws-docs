**Example – Reading from a New Relic entity**
The following example reads from the `alerts_policies` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your New Relic connection:

    connection_type="newrelic",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "alerts_policies"
    }
)
```
