# Reading from Todoist entities
<a name="todoist-reading-from-entities"></a>

**Prerequisites**

A Todoist object you want to read from. For the available entities, see the following supported entities table.

Some entities require a parent identifier in `ENTITY_NAME`. Use `collaborators/{{projectId}}`, `comments/{{taskId}}`, `folders/{{workspaceId}}`, or `workspace_invitations/{{workspaceId}}`. AWS Glue discovers the available project, task, and workspace IDs for your connection.

**Supported entities for source**

**Example – Reading from a Todoist entity**
The following example reads from the `activities` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Todoist connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="todoist",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "activities"
    }
)
```
