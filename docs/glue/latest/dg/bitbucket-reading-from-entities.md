**Example – Reading from a Bitbucket entity**
The following Python example reads the `branches` entity of one repository. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Bitbucket connection, {{workspace}} with the workspace slug, and {{repoSlug}} with the repository slug:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="bitbucket",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "branches/{{workspace}}/{{repoSlug}}"
    }
)
```
