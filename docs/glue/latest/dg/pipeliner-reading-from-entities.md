**Example – Reading from a Pipeliner entity**
The following example reads from the `Accounts` entity. Replace {{connectionName}} with the name of your Pipeliner connection:

```
read_df = glueContext.create_dynamic_frame.from_options(
    connection_type="pipeliner",
    connection_options={
        "connectionName": "{{connectionName}}",
        "ENTITY_NAME": "Accounts"
    }
)
```
