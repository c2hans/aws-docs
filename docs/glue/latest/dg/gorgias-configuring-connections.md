# Configuring Gorgias connections
<a name="gorgias-configuring-connections"></a>

Gorgias connections use basic authentication. You store the credential in Secrets Manager and reference that secret when you create the connection in AWS Glue Studio.

To configure a Gorgias connection:

1. Obtain your Gorgias API credential (see the Gorgias API documentation on the Gorgias website).

1. In Secrets Manager, create a secret with the keys `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` set to your Gorgias credentials.

1. In the AWS Glue Studio console, choose **Connections** under **Data Catalog**, then choose **Create connection**.

1. Search for and choose Gorgias as the data source.

1. For credentials, choose the Secrets Manager secret you created, select the IAM role that AWS Glue can assume to read the secret, optionally set network options, and complete the connection creation.

1. Grant the IAM role associated with your AWS Glue job permission to read the secret.
