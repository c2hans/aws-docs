# Delegating an administrator account
<a name="delegate-administrator-account"></a>

With AWS Compute Optimizer, you can make one member account in your organization the delegated administrator. This account can view and manage Compute Optimizer recommendations for the whole organization. It can do this without signing in to the management account.

The management account chooses the delegated administrator. Each organization can have only one delegated administrator for Compute Optimizer at a time.

As the delegated administrator, you can do the following:
+ Get and export recommendations.
+ Set recommendation preferences.
+ Set the opt-in status of member accounts.
+ Get projected utilization metrics.

**Note**
Keep the following in mind about delegated administrator access:
You can limit your delegated administrator's access to Compute Optimizer actions. To do this, set up IAM permissions in your IAM policy. For more information, see [Policies and permissions in IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/PoliciesOverview.html).
If you're the delegated administrator and you want to view org-level recommendations, see [ Policies to grant access to Compute Optimizer for a management account of an organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/compute-optimizer/latest/ug/security-iam.html#organization-account-access).
