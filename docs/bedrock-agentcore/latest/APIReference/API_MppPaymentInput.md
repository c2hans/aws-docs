Authorizes the service to sign a payment whose blockchain network (gas) fees are charged to your wallet, on top of the payment amount.
The challenge indicates who sponsors the network fees. When the challenge does not sponsor them, the service signs the payment only if this field is `true`. Otherwise it returns a validation error, so you can decide whether to pay the fees or obtain a challenge that sponsors them.
Optional. When omitted or `false`, you decline to pay network fees. This field has no effect on challenges that already sponsor the fees.
Type: Boolean
