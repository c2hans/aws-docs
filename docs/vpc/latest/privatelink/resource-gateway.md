# Resource gateway in VPC Lattice
<a name="resource-gateway"></a>

A resource gateway is a point of inbound traffic into the VPC where a resource resides. It spans multiple Availability Zones.

A VPC must have a resource gateway if you plan to make resources inside the VPC accessible from other VPCs or accounts. Every resource you share is associated with a resource gateway. When clients in other VPCs or accounts access a resource in your VPC, the resource sees traffic coming locally from the resource gateway in that VPC. The source IP of the traffic is the IP address of the resource gateway. You can assign multiple IP addresses to a resource gateway to allow for more network connections with the resource. Multiple resources in a VPC can be associated with the same resource gateway.

A resource gateway does not provide load balancing capabilities.

## Considerations
<a name="resource-gateway-considerations"></a>

The following considerations apply to resource gateways:
+ For your resource to be accessible from all [Availability Zones](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/regions_az/), you should create your resource gateways to span as many Availability Zones as possible.
+ At least one Availability Zone of the VPC endpoint and the resource gateway have to overlap.
+ A VPC has a default quota of 500 resource gateways, which is adjustable. For more information, see [Quotas for VPC Lattice](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc-lattice/latest/ug/quotas.html).
+ The following considerations apply to resource gateways with shared VPC subnets:
  + The VPC owner, or a participant account that a subnet is shared with, can create a resource gateway in a shared VPC subnet.
  + Only the account that owns the resource gateway can create a resource configuration for that resource gateway.
  + The quota for the maximum number of resource gateways per VPC is enforced at the VPC owner account. Only the VPC owner can request an increase to this quota. This quota counts all resource gateways in the VPC, including those that participant accounts create in the VPC's shared subnets.
  + The VPC owner can't view or modify the resource gateways that participant accounts create, or the resource configurations for those resource gateways.
  + A participant account must specify at least one security group for its resource gateway, and must own every security group that it specifies. A participant account can't use the VPC's default security group or security groups that are shared with it. Specifying one of these returns a "cannot be found" error.
  + For a resource gateway that a participant account creates, the IP address and CIDR targets of a resource configuration must be within the subnets that are shared with that participant account. Each CIDR must be within a single shared subnet. IP address and CIDR ranges in on-premises networks, peered VPCs, or subnets that aren't shared with the participant account are rejected. Resources that other accounts own within the shared subnets are supported.
  + A resource configuration that targets an Amazon RDS database by ARN must reference a database in the resource gateway owner's account.
  + To reach a resource outside the shared subnets, such as an Amazon RDS database in the VPC owner's account, use a domain-name target. Domain-name targets aren't checked against the shared subnet ranges and work as long as routing allows.

## Security groups
<a name="resource-gateway-security-groups"></a>

You can attach security groups to a resource gateway. Security group rules for resource gateways control outbound traffic from the resource gateway to resources.

** Recommended outbound rules for traffic flowing from a resource gateway to a database resource**

For traffic to flow from a resource gateway to a resource, you must create outbound rules for the resource's accepted listener protocols and port ranges.

| Destination | Protocol | Port range | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| {{CIDR range for resource}} | TCP | 3306 | Allows traffic from resource gateway to databases. |

## IP address types
<a name="resource-gateway-ip-address-type"></a>

A resource gateway can have IPv4, IPv6, or dual-stack addresses. The IP address type of a resource gateway must be compatible with the subnets of the resource gateway and the IP address type of the resource, as described here:
+ **IPv4** – Assign IPv4 addresses to your gateway network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets have IPv4 address ranges, and the resource also has an IPv4 address.
+ **IPv6** – Assign IPv6 addresses to your gateway network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets are IPv6-only subnets, and the resource also has an IPv6 address.
+ **Dualstack** – Assign both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to your gateway network interfaces. This option is supported only if all selected subnets have both IPv4 and IPv6 address ranges, and the resource either has an IPv4 or an IPv6 address.

The IP address type of the resource gateway is independent of the IP address type of the client or the VPC endpoint through which the resource is accessed.

## IPv4 addresses per ENI
<a name="ipv4-address-type-per-eni"></a>

If your resource gateway has an IPv4 or a dual-stack IP address type, you can configure the number of IPv4 addresses assigned to each ENI of your resource gateway. When you create a resource gateway, you choose from 1 to 62 IPv4 addresses. After you set the number of IPv4 addresses, the value can't be changed.

The IPv4 addresses are used for network address translation and determine the maximum number of concurrent IPv4 connections to a resource. By default, all resource gateways are assigned 16 IPv4 addresses per ENI. This is a suitable number of IPs to form connections with your backend resources.

If your resource gateway uses the IPv6 address type, the resource gateway automatically receives a /80 CIDR per ENI. This value can't be changed.

## Resource Config DNS Resolution
<a name="resource-config-dns-resolution"></a>

You can specify how a resource gateway performs DNS resolution for resource configurations that are domain-name targets. This property is immutable. You can choose:
+ ** PUBLIC (default)** - Domain names are resolved using public DNS resolvers.
+ ** IN\_VPC ** - Domain names are resolved using the DNS server configured in the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) option set of the VPC which the resource gateway is in. You should use this if you are using a private DNS server or your domain-name targets are in a Route 53 private hosted zone.

The following table lists the constraints that apply when DNS resolution is set to IN\_VPC.

| Constraint | Details |
| --- | --- |
| IPv6 only subnet support | You can't attach an IN\_VPC enabled resource gateway to an IPv6 only subnet. |
| ARN resource configurations | You can't attach resource configurations defined by ARN to the resource gateway. |
| DNS transport protocol | DNS queries use UDP only. TCP fallback isn't supported. |
| Maximum DNS payload size | VPC Lattice advertises a maximum DNS payload size of 8,400 bytes. Because TCP fallback isn't supported, DNS resolution fails for responses larger than this size. |
| Recursive DNS resolver | The DNS resolver must be recursive. If a response contains a CNAME record, the response must also contain the records that the CNAME resolves to. |

To attach a CIDR resource configuration to a resource gateway, it must have `IN_VPC` enabled.

DHCP option set DNS server changes take 24 hours to propagate to a resource gateway that uses `IN_VPC` DNS resolution.
