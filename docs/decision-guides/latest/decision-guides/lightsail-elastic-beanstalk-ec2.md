## Introduction
<a name="introduction"></a>

 Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers services that can meet your needs for a cloud platform or compute web service. Three services that are often considered alongside one another are:
+ **Amazon Lightsail** — a set of core services designed to help you build websites or web applications. Consider Lightsail if you want a simple unified platform with a few foundational services, including virtual servers, HTTP load balancing, managed databases, public container deployment, content delivery network (CDN), DNS management, and domain registration. Lightsail provides fixed and predictable monthly pricing.
+ **AWS Elastic Beanstalk** — a service that makes it easy to deploy, manage, and scale web applications and services. It supports several programming languages such as Python, Java, PHP, Node.js, Ruby, .NET, and Go. With Elastic Beanstalk, you simply upload your application code, and AWS handles the underlying infrastructure, including provisioning resources like Amazon EC2 instances, load balancers, and databases, as well as auto-scaling and monitoring. It provides built-in integration with AWS services like RDS, Amazon S3, and CloudWatch. Elastic Beanstalk offers a balance between control and automation, giving developers the ability to customize infrastructure while offloading operational overhead. There is no additional charge for Elastic Beanstalk. You pay for AWS resources (e.g. Amazon EC2 instances or Amazon S3 buckets) you create to store and run your application.
+ **Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** — an AWS service that provides on-demand, scalable computing capacity, with the goal of allowing you to develop, deploy, and scale applications faster. You can use it to launch as many or as few compute instances as you need, configure security and networking, and manage storage. You can also add capacity by provisioning larger instances (up to hundreds of cores and thousands of GiB memory) or load balancing clusters of smaller instances. Several different pricing models are available depending on your requirements.

 When choosing between Lightsail, Elastic Beanstalk, and Amazon EC2, keep in mind the future growth of your workload and how you intend to grow your AWS environment. If your future deployment requires advanced networking or integration with AWS services such as Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS), Amazon DynamoDB, or AWS Lambda, you should strongly consider using Amazon EC2.

Here's a high-level view of the key differences between these services to get you started.

## Details on the differences
<a name="lse-differences"></a>

Explore differences between Lightsail, AWS Elastic Beanstalk, and Amazon EC2 in six areas. These cover ease of use, compute and block storage, container deployments, load balancing, content delivery network, and managed database support.

------
#### [ Ease of use ]

**Ease of use**

Lightsail offers a set of core services to deploy web servers and database backed applications, with support for load balancing, containers, content delivery network (CDN), DNS management, and domain registration. You can also choose from a set of application blueprints to deploy standard applications such as a WordPress site, or LAMP stack application. Lightsail is a good fit for organizations with simple website and application requirements, and those who prefer fixed, predictable monthly pricing.

 Elastic Beanstalk, on the other hand, is a more flexible service for deploying and scaling web applications. It supports multiple programming languages and web servers, automatically handles capacity provisioning, load balancing, auto-scaling, and application health monitoring. Elastic Beanstalk integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like RDS and CloudWatch, allowing for more complex architectures and fine-grained control over the underlying resources.

With Amazon EC2, you have greater flexibility to configure workloads over a broader set of compute capacities, features, and integrations with other AWS services. Amazon EC2 provides more flexible purchase options including on-demand hourly and lower commit-based pricing. A typical deployment of Amazon EC2 may require the use of other AWS services, such as databases and load balancers, that each have their own pricing models and configuration details.

------
#### [ Compute and block storage ]

**Compute and block storage**

Lightsail provides multiple options for your instance size, ranging from 2 vCPUs, 512 MiB memory, and 20 GB of SSD storage, up to 64 vCPUs, 256 GiB of memory, and 1280 GB of SSD storage. Lightsail compute instances also include a generous free data transfer allocation, and are billed with fixed, predictable pricing.

Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon EC2 support hundreds of instance types supporting any workload, with 1 to 100s of vCPUs, and 1000s of GiB RAM. Multiple individually sized storage volumes can be attached to Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon EC2 instances with various performance tiers. Elastic Beanstalk and Amazon EC2 also both support Spot Instances and Graviton-based instances, allowing cost-efficient scaling and high-performance computing.

------
#### [ Container deployments ]

**Container deployments**

Lightsail containers provide a straightforward way to get started deploying public container images on AWS compute instances, with 0.25 vCPUs and 512 MiB RAM, to 4 vCPUs and 8 GiB RAM. Every Lightsail container deployment comes with 500 GB of data transfer for a fixed monthly fee.

Elastic Beanstalk can run individual Docker containers, multiple containers with Docker Compose, or deploy to Amazon ECS, a fully managed container orchestration service which manages and scales the Amazon EC2 instances running containers.

Containers can be self-managed on Amazon EC2, or deployed to a fully managed AWS container service such as Amazon ECS, Amazon EKS, App Runner, Elastic Beanstalk, and Lambda. These services support both public and private images, more flexible hourly or commit-based billing, and greater vertical and horizontal scaling capabilities.

------
#### [ Load balancing ]

**Load balancing**

Lightsail provides a simple HTTP or HTTPS load balancer for low volume web traffic (up to 5 GB and 400k connections per hour). Lightsail load balancers handle certificate management and are available for a fixed monthly cost.

 You can [enable load balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/using-features-managing-env-types.html#using-features.managing.changetype) for your Elastic Beanstalk environment, which will create an [Elastic Load Balancing](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/userguide/) load balancer dedicated to your environment. Elastic Beanstalk fully manages this load balancer, taking care of security settings and of terminating the load balancer when you terminate your environment.

 Alternatively, you can choose to share a load balancer across several Elastic Beanstalk environments. With a shared load balancer, you save on operational cost by avoiding a dedicated load balancer for each environment. Elastic Beanstalk supports the Classic Load Balancer, the Application Load Balancer, and the Network Application Load Balancer types.

Amazon EC2 Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) offers a broader and more scalable range of load balancer options using more flexible on demand or commit pricing. Amazon EC2 load balancers support both application (HTTP, HTTPS, WebSockets) and network (TCP, UDP) traffic.

------
#### [ Content delivery network ]

**Content delivery network**

To improve web content load time, Lightsail lets you add a content delivery network (CDN) distribution to your website or application. Lightsail CDN distributions are available in three monthly data transfer tiers, including 50 GB included for the first year, 200 GB, and 500 GB, for a fixed monthly price.

After you have created and deployed your Elastic Beanstalk application you can sign up for CloudFront and start using CloudFront to distribute your content.

Amazon EC2 and Elastic Load Balancing work directly with the Amazon CloudFront CDN (the same CDN used by Lightsail). Using CloudFront directly offers more integration possibilities with other AWS services or external origins. It also offers more flexible on demand and commit-based pricing than Lightsail.

------
#### [ Managed database support ]

**Managed database support**

Lightsail offers managed databases in six standard, and six high availability configurations, ranging from 1 to 4 processor cores, 1 GiB to 32 GiB RAM, and 40 GB to 960 GB storage. Lightsail databases are billed using a fixed, predictable monthly price.

Elastic Beanstalk provides integration with [Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS)](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/). You can use Elastic Beanstalk to add a MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, or SQL Server database to an existing environment or a new one when you create it. When you add a database instance, Elastic Beanstalk provides the connection information to your application. It does this by setting the environment properties for the database hostname, port, user name, password, and database name. You can also connect to an external database managed outside of Elastic Beanstalk which allows you to use database types that aren't supported with integrated databases. This option will require additional security group and connection string configuration.

Amazon EC2 works directly with Amazon RDS and NoSQL services, such as Amazon DynamoDB. Amazon RDS offers a more scalable and broader range of configurations, including fixed instance types ranging from 2 to dozens of vCPUs, and 100s of GiB RAM, unlimited storage, and seamlessly scalable serverless options.
