### Sample queries
<a name="data-lake-coaching-session-record-sample-queries"></a>

The following example query in Amazon Athena lists shared coaching sessions that are past due:

```
SELECT
    coaching_session_id,
    session_title,
    coach_user_id,
    participant_user_id,
    session_due_timestamp
FROM "{{coaching-session-record-resource-link-table-name}}"
WHERE instance_id = '{{instance-id}}'
    AND to_delete = false
    AND record_type = 'SESSION_PARTICIPANT'
    AND session_status = 'SHARED'
    AND session_due_timestamp < CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
ORDER BY session_due_timestamp;
```

The following example query in Amazon Athena ranks evaluation-form topics by the number of completed coaching sessions:

```
SELECT
    evaluation_form_id,
    evaluation_form_version,
    evaluation_form_item_reference_id,
    MAX(evaluation_form_item_title) AS topic_title,
    COUNT(DISTINCT coaching_session_id) AS coaching_session_count
FROM "{{coaching-session-record-resource-link-table-name}}"
WHERE instance_id = '{{instance-id}}'
    AND to_delete = false
    AND record_type = 'TOPIC'
    AND topic_source = 'EVALUATION_FORM'
    AND session_status = 'COMPLETE'
    AND session_completion_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP '{{start-date}}'
    AND session_completion_timestamp < TIMESTAMP '{{end-date}}'
GROUP BY evaluation_form_id, evaluation_form_version, evaluation_form_item_reference_id
ORDER BY coaching_session_count DESC;
```

The following example query in Amazon Athena compares topic metrics for sessions completed during a time range:

```
SELECT
    coaching_session_id,
    record_id AS topic_id,
    label,
    topic_source,
    scoring_mode,
    metric_at_creation,
    goal_metric,
    metric_at_completion,
    metric_at_follow_up,
    goal_status
FROM "{{coaching-session-record-resource-link-table-name}}"
WHERE instance_id = '{{instance-id}}'
    AND to_delete = false
    AND record_type = 'TOPIC'
    AND session_status = 'COMPLETE'
    AND session_completion_timestamp >= TIMESTAMP '{{start-date}}'
    AND session_completion_timestamp < TIMESTAMP '{{end-date}}'
ORDER BY coaching_session_id, topic_id;
```
