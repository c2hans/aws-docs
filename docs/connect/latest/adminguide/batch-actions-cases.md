# Batch actions on Cases
<a name="batch-actions-cases"></a>

You can apply an action to multiple cases at the same time by using batch case actions, without opening and updating each case individually. You can assign cases, update their status, add a comment, or export selected cases as CSV. The actions available to you depend on your security profile permissions.

## Prerequisites
<a name="batch-actions-cases-prerequisites"></a>

To use batch case actions, your security profile must include the **Cases** - **Cases bulk action** permission. Without this permission, the **Actions** dropdown is not available in the Cases search view. For information about configuring security profiles, see [Security profile permissions for Cases](assign-security-profile-cases.md).

The following image shows the **Cases bulk action** permission selected in a security profile.
