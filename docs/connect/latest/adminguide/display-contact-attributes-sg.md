# Display contact context in the agent workspace when a contact begins in Connect Customer
<a name="display-contact-attributes-sg"></a>

When you design step-by-step guides for the agent workspace, you can set them up to display contact attributes at the start of the contact. This gives agents the context they need at the start of the contact so they can dive right into problem solving. This feature is sometimes referred to as a screen pop.

To display contact attributes at the start of a contact, you configure a **Detail view**, which is an [AWS managed view](view-resources-managed-view.md).

The **Detail view** shows information and a list of actions the user can take. For example, use it for a screen pop at the start of a call.
+ Actions can move the user to the next step in a step-by-step guide or start a new workflow.
+ `Sections`, the body of the page, is the only required component.
+ The view also supports optional components, such as `AttributeBar`.

**Tip**
For interactive documentation that shows a preview of a **Detail view**, see [Detail](https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/docs/aws-managed-views-detail--with-all).

The following image shows an example of a **Detail view**. It has a page heading, description, and four examples.

**Sections**
+ Content can be a static string, a TemplateString, or a key-value pair. It can be a single data point or a list. For more information, see [TemplateString](https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/docs/aws-managed-views-common-configuration--page#templatestring) or [AttributeSection](https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/docs/aws-managed-views-common-configuration--page#attribute-section).

**AttributeBar (Optional)**
+ Optional. If provided, displays the Attribute bar at the top of the view.
+ A list of objects with required properties, `Label`, `Value`, and optional properties `LinkType`, `ResourceId`, `Copyable` and `Url`. For more information, see [Attribute](https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/docs/aws-managed-views-common-configuration--page#attribute).
  + `LinkType` can be `external` or a Connect Customer application, such as `case`.
    + When it is *external*, an agent can navigate to a new browser page, which is configured with `Url`.
    + When it's `case`, the link opens the case that `ResourceId` identifies in the agent workspace.
  + `Copyable` lets users copy the `ResourceId` by choosing it.

**Back (Optional)**
+ Optional, but required if the view has no actions. If provided, displays the back navigation link.
+ Is an object with a *Label* which will control what is displayed in the link text.

**Heading (Optional)**
+ Optional. If provided, displays Text as the title.

**Description (Optional)**
+ Optional. If provided, displays description text under the title.

**Actions (Optional)**
+ Optional. If provided, displays a list of actions at the bottom of the page.
