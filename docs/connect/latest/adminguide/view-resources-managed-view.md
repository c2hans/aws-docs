# Set up AWS managed views in Connect Customer
<a name="view-resources-managed-view"></a>

Connect Customer includes a set of AWS managed views. Choose a tab to see how to configure each one.

------
#### [ Detail view ]

The **Detail view** shows information and a list of actions the user can take. For example, use it for a screen pop at the start of a call.
+ Actions can move the user to the next step in a step-by-step guide or start a new workflow.
+ `Sections`, the body of the page, is the only required component.
+ The view also supports optional components, such as `AttributeBar`.

For an interactive example, see the [Detail view](https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/docs/aws-managed-views-detail--with-all) in the UI component reference.

The following image shows an example of a **Detail view**. It has a page heading, description, and four examples.

![The detail view, with the page heading, description, and four examples with attributes.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/images/details-view-page-heading-sq.png)

**Sections**
+ Content can be a static string, a TemplateString, or a key-value pair. It can be a single data point or a list. For more information, see [TemplateString](https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/docs/aws-managed-views-common-configuration--page#templatestring) or [AttributeSection](https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/docs/aws-managed-views-common-configuration--page#attribute-section).

**AttributeBar (Optional)**
+ Optional. If provided, displays the Attribute bar at the top of the view.
+ Is a list of objects with required properties, `Label`, `Value`, and optional properties `LinkType`, `ResourceId`, `Copyable` and `Url`. For more information, see [Attribute](https://d3irlmavjxd3d8.cloudfront.net/?path=/docs/aws-managed-views-common-configuration--page#attribute).
  + `LinkType` can be `external` or a Connect Customer application, such as `case`.
    + When it is *external*, a user can navigate to a new browser page, which is configured with `Url`.
    + When it's `case`, the link opens the case that `ResourceId` identifies in the agent workspace.
  + `Copyable` lets users copy the `ResourceId` by choosing it.

**Back (Optional)**
+ Optional, but required if the view has no actions. If provided, displays the back navigation link.
+ Is an object with a *Label* which will control what is displayed in the link text.

**Heading (Optional)**
