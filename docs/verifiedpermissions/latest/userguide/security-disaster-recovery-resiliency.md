# Resilience in Amazon Verified Permissions
<a name="security-disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.

When you create a Verified Permissions policy store , it is created within an individual AWS Region, and is automatically replicated across the data centers that make up that Region's Availability Zones. At this time, Verified Permissions doesn't support any cross-region replication.

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).
