# Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) for AWS PCS
<a name="working-with_ami"></a>

AWS PCS launches compute nodes from an AMI that you choose, so you control the software and configuration on the compute nodes in your cluster. For production AI/ML and HPC workloads, you can use the AWS-maintained PCS-ready AWS Deep Learning AMI (DLAMI). If you're evaluating AWS PCS, you can use a sample AMI that AWS provides. You can also build your own AMI for full control over your compute nodes.

You can specify the AMI on the compute node group with `amiId`, in its custom launch template, or both. With standard configuration, you must specify `amiId`. If you specify an AMI in both places, AWS PCS uses `amiId` instead of the AMI in the launch template. To use the AMI in the custom launch template instead, set `amiId` to an empty string (`""`) when you update the compute node group. For more information, see [Configuring instance settings for compute node groups in AWS PCS](working-with_cng_instance-settings.md).
