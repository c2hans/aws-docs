# Triggering a scan
<a name="cv-triggering-scan"></a>

When you create an environment, AWS Continuum starts the first scan, even if you select **Manual only**. Use the scan frequency to control recurring scans. By default, AWS Continuum scans your code every day. If you select **Manual only**, AWS Continuum doesn't run automatic recurring scans. You can also queue a scan manually from the console.

To change the scan frequency, do the following.

1. Open the AWS Continuum console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/continuum/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/continuum/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Environments**, and then choose the environment name.

1. Choose the **Scans** tab.

1. Choose **Configure scan frequency**.

1. For **Scan frequency**, select one of the following values:
   + **Every day**
   + **Every 2 days**
   + **Every 7 days**
   + **Manual only**

1. Choose **Save**.

To queue a manual scan, do the following. You can't cancel a scan after you queue it.

1. Open the AWS Continuum console at [https://console.aws.amazon.com/continuum/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/continuum/).

1. In the navigation pane, choose **Environments**, and then choose the environment name.

1. Choose the **Scans** tab.

1. Choose **Queue scan**.

1. In the **Queue scan?** dialog, choose **Queue scan**.

1. Choose the **Refresh scans** icon. Check the scan's status in the **Status** column.

If a failure reason is available for a failed scan, choose **Failed** in the **Status** column. The **Failure reason** popover shows the explanation. For a scan that found no supported source files, see [No supported source files](#cv-triggering-scan-no-supported-source).

After a scan reaches **Succeeded** status, AWS Continuum might continue processing issues and generating patches. To view available results, see [Viewing discovered issues](cv-viewing-issues.md) and [Viewing generated patches](cv-viewing-patches.md).

## No supported source files
<a name="cv-triggering-scan-no-supported-source"></a>

If AWS Continuum finds no supported source files in the selected repositories, the scan fails with the following message:

No source files in a supported language were found in the selected repositories.

Check the file extensions and folder locations in your code source against [Supported languages and source files](cv-supported-languages.md). A repository that contains only documentation, unsupported file extensions, or files in excluded folders doesn't provide supported source files.

After you update the code source to include supported source files outside the excluded folders, queue another scan.
