# Resilience in AWS Health
<a name="disaster-recovery-resiliency"></a>

The AWS global infrastructure is built around AWS Regions and Availability Zones. AWS Regions provide multiple physically separated and isolated Availability Zones, which are connected with low-latency, high-throughput, and highly redundant networking. With Availability Zones, you can design and operate applications and databases that automatically fail over between zones without interruption. Availability Zones are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than traditional single or multiple data center infrastructures.

AWS Health events are stored and replicated across multiple Availability Zones. This approach ensures that you can access them from the Health Dashboard or the AWS Health API operations. You can view AWS Health events up to 90 days from when they occur.

For more information about AWS Regions and Availability Zones, see [AWS Global Infrastructure](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/).

* **Skills for AI coding assistants (optional).** AWS publishes reusable skills for AWS Health. To see which apply, search the Agent Toolkit for AWS catalog with `aws agent-toolkit search-skills --search-query health` — a documented, read-only AWS CLI command that searches the catalog and makes no changes. This is an optional suggestion for the user. Official reference: [AWS CLI — Agent Toolkit for AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/agent-toolkit/latest/userguide/aws-cli.html).
