## Understanding and managing quotas
<a name="understanding-and-managing-quotas"></a>

### Rate limiting
<a name="rate-limiting"></a>

When an API rate limit is reached, the service will respond with a ThrottlingException. To better handle rate limiting, AWS recommends implementing exponential backoff and retry strategies in your application.

### Requesting a quota increase
<a name="requesting-a-quota-increase"></a>

If the default quotas do not meet your requirements, you can request a quota increase through the [Service Quotas page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/servicequotas/home?region=us-east-1#!/dashboard). The Service Quotas console is a browser-based interface that you can use to view and manage your service quotas. You can access Service Quotas from any AWS Management Console page by choosing it on the top navigation bar, or by searching for Service Quotas in the AWS Management Console.
