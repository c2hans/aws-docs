# Troubleshooting with AWS assistant
<a name="troubleshooting-with-Q"></a>

You can use the [AWS assistant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assistant/latest/userguide/what-is.html) in the Amazon ECS console to help diagnose and resolve issues with your Amazon ECS resources. For certain errors and status messages on containers, tasks, services, deployments, and task definitions, the console shows an **Inspect with AWS assistant** option. When you choose this option, the AWS assistant analyzes the issue in context and suggests possible causes and remediation steps.

## Considerations
<a name="troubleshooting-with-Q-considerations"></a>

Consider the following when using the AWS assistant with Amazon ECS:
+ **Button availability** - The "Inspect with AWS assistant" button is only displayed for resources experiencing potential issues. This option is not available for healthy resources.
+ **Read-only operations** - The AWS assistant integration performs only read operations. It makes no mutating or write actions.
+ **Cross-region processing** - The AWS assistant may process data across AWS regions to provide AI-powered analysis. For more information about cross-region processing, see [Cross-Region processing in AWS assistant](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/assistant/latest/userguide/cross-region-processing.html).
+ ** Console only** - This integration is available only through the Console. It is not available through the AWS CLI, AWS APIs, or infrastructure as code tools.
